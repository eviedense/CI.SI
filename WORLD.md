Cisila Jane Siveta works to achieve something, but what that something is, she doesn't know. After losing her father, then her mother, she was left alone in her life when she turned 20.

Her father died when she was 16, during a military campaign. His body was never found- and his grave remains empty. Her mother died when was 20, killed by the pharmaceutical company PALMER-EDEN. The company she worked for. Cisila herself had been taken by PALMER-EDEN and experimented on- as part of a punishment for her mother. It didn't work- and they killed her.

PALMER-EDEN turned Cisila into an "Ultima"- a superhuman. An organ shoved inside her that didn't belong turned her into a person with the ability to create anything with her hands- *anything.* If she understood how it worked, how it was made, she could construct it from nothing.
