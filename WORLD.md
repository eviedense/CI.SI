#### 'V' - Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz - Cyberpunk 2077

Cisila Jane Siveta works to achieve something, but what that something is, she doesn't know. After losing her father, then her mother, she was left alone in her life when she turned 20.

Her father died when she was 16, during a military campaign. His body was never found- and his grave remains empty. Her mother died when was 20, killed by the pharmaceutical company PALMER-EDEN. The company she worked for. Cisila herself had been taken by PALMER-EDEN and experimented on- as part of a punishment for her mother. It didn't work- and they killed her.

PALMER-EDEN turned Cisila into an *"Ultima"*- a superhuman. An organ shoved inside her that didn't belong turned her into a person with the ability to create anything with her hands- *anything.* If she understood how it worked, how it was made, she could construct it from nothing.

The only thing she couldn't do was create an organism. Her abilities stopped at living things. Cisila left Chicago for a period of time after the experiment to take up a fire lookout position in Montana with her sister. During this time, she learned how to use her abilities. She learned that in addition to her Construct ability, a strange skeleton of metal and wires would bind itself around her almost like a protective exoskeleton. She'd call it "EXO". When she finally returned to Chicago, she used what money she had from her parents and bought herself an apartment- one she could barely fit in. She knew she couldn't keep living in her childhood home, so she took what she could from the house. 

She managed to find a job rather quickly- a large bookstore that reminded one of a library with its sheer size. She'd work there, day in, and day out. But by night, she'd put on a mask she'd constructed during her time in Montana. She'd create her own outfit so that nobody would recognize her- and leap out into the neon night city. Every night, she would gather more evidence and info on PALMER-EDEN, in an attempt to figure out how much they'd done this, *where* they were getting the Ultima organs- and most importantly, how to make them stop. She meets a strange cult-like organization that, while slightly strange, offers to help her. She meets Dani, the leader. Dani is the only person Cisila (or "V", the organization's nickname for her) trusts to help her. For months, they'd scour the underworld of the city- run into the three gangs, and dig deeper into what PALMER-EDEN's purpose really is.

And then there was Mikhail. At first, Cisila felt a connection. They decided to go out- and for the first few months, it was good. But as Cisila got more tired and tired from her lack of sleep, the two drifted apart. There was *a* connection that had happened, but Cisila didn't know what. 

She would eventually find out. And meet someone who she *really* had a connection to.

## LYLA SILVERMANN
### Age: 27 (as of 2033) - Born on October 31st, 2006 
### Residence: Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A
#### Theme: https://open.spotify.com/track/264qDQ2c4dMxIRbku7PN8E?si=fe882dbbef254597
#### 'Vendetta' - FreQuency - Armored Core Verdict Day

Lyla Silvermann is lost. She doesn't think she deserves to live.

Her parents use her like a weapon. She *is* a weapon, practically. Back in Finland, she was an assassin. If you could call her one- she wasn't exactly subtle.

Ripping her victims apart like they were pieces of thin paper, she'd leave their houses covered in blood. Did she enjoy it? No. But she had to do it- lest her family kick her out and leave her with nothing.
