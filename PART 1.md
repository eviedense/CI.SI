*Five, four, three, two...one.* As the rain pelted down on the city of Chicago, a hooded figure watchd a black SUV roll through the streets, standing out from the rest of the traffic by *not* standing out. The figure watched carefully, a single mechanical eye in their mask glowing a light purple as it followed the SUV.

This particular street was always a mess of neon signs, people, and in the background, crime. In between the buildings, in the grimy alleyways where diners threw out their trash, criminals hid. They weren't normal criminals, nor were they able to be stopped by the police *(Not that they did anything)*. The figure stood up, and look towards the next building. They looked as though they were wearing the battered exoskeleton of an armored suit, that weaved around their arms and legs, even piercing their chest. Thin pipes skewed in and out of their body, and wires extruded from her arms, wrapping around the metal. It was a mess. Suddenly, the figure breaks into a sprint, leaping over the gap between the two buildings. Their jump felt powerful, like a spring. As soon as they landed, with the softest *thud*, they continued to sprint, stumbling. They were clearly following the SUV.

*I've had this planned for weeks,* she thought. *But what if they take a different turn?*

Then her route would be messed up. Under the mask that only covered the left half of her face (her hair covered her right), her face was contorted into worry. The SUV was supposed to be driving right towards the largest tower in the city, owned by a pharmaceutical company named PALMER-EDEN. The place was a disgrace, she thought to herself. It was where she, Cisila, gained her powers. It was *why* she had this strange exoskeleton on her. 

She continued to follow the SUV, and it seemed to follow the path she had figured out. She slid under obstacles, leaped over AC units in her way, but still seemed inexperienced with her parkour. Everytime she vaulted over something, she stumbled, and sometimes fell to the ground - but she continued to keep up. Buildings flew past her as she picked up speed. Cisila saw the SUV turn to the left, in the middle of an intersection. *NOW!* her head screamed. The edge of the last building was fast approaching her - she'd have to jump off and use one of the street lamps to vault towards the SUV without crushing it. She felt herself tense up as the edge was suddenly there-

And she leaped. As she dove straight off the building, she saw that this street didn't have normal street lamps. She swore out loud (though nobody could hear her) and went into a dive. She'd just have to use the strange suspended lights as monkey bars until she got close enough. These street lights were a new implementation, to give the sidewalks *slightly* more space. They hung from building to building, giving the strangest feeling of a cobweb. She dove straight through them, avoiding getting tangled, and she reached up. She dragged a set of lights down with her for a couple of metres, and swung her legs back to give herself some momentum. She swung herself forward, catching each set of lights above her with her hands. Below her, people watched her, probably thinking this was some kind of trick. Cisila had taught herself to ignore them. One hand in front of the other, she was making her way towards the SUV, which had stopped at a red light for the moment. One, two, one and two. 

In a moment, she was above the SUV - and the light had turned green. She swung her legs back and forth in unison, and threw herself forward. The momentum had sent her into a backflip right towards the SUV, and she swung her legs out to make sure she landed upright. The SUV hadn't picked up enough speed to get away, but even then, her legs hit the pavement. She had to lunge forward and grab onto the trunk to stay on. Almost immediately, her shoes began to drag and she smelled the vague smell of...burning shoes. Cisila looked down and immediately realized, that obviously, her shoes wouldn't survive. She forced herself to climb up onto the top of the SUV. Lying down on her stomach, she flung her right arm out as if summoning Mjolnir, and out of her hand, coming together like a complex mechanical puzzle, complete with *clicks* and *clacks* as it put itself together, was a blade. She flipped it around in her hand so she was holding it backhanded, and stabbed it right into the windshield of the SUV. The glass shattered around the puncture, and she heard the driver slam the brakes - she'd stabbed the passenger, just as she thought.

She ripped the blade back out and let it deconstruct into her hand. She was about to get up when a bullet flew right past her. She turned back, and spotted another SUV following them, but this one had someone with a gun leaning out of the passenger side. In her hands, she constructed a throwing knife. She hadn't ever been able to construct a pistol, so a knife was the best she could do. She turned onto her back, and flung the knife towards the car. It hit the SUV's hood, puncturing it. She constructed another one and flung it once more. Her eyes went wide when she realized she'd completely missed and punctured someone else's tire. The car skidded to a stop, and the car behind it ran straight into it. Eventually, there was a pileup back there. But that was neither here nor there, because- another bullet flew by her. *Damned security,* she thought. She didn't have anywhere to go, she realized. Buildings were flying by her as the SUV took a route away from PALMER-EDEN, and she'd lost track of where they were. The rain fell down harder, pittering and pattering against the hood and roof of the SUV. Her jacket and the rest of her outfit was *drenched.* Desperately clinging onto the roof, she knew she'd have to jump off at some point.

She shook her head and clambered up onto her feet, barely keeping balance. She constructed one more knife for good measure and flung her arm out to throw it, when-

The man in the SUV took another shot and got her in the shoulder. She dropped the knife as the pain spread through her body. Then another shot whizzed right by her head, grazing the hood of her sweater. Then...a final shot hit her leg. And Cisila knew she wouldn't have another chance to get the hell *out,* as her adrenaline kicked in. She looked up, seeing the ropelights above her. She looked down at the armed man in the other SUV, and jumped up, grabbing hold of a set of lights. The SUVs quickly disappeared down the street as she climbed down to the sidewalk.

The pain had suddenly set in, and her shoulder felt like it was screaming. She leaned against the building she had climbed down on, and realized her mask was still on. She pulled her hood further up, and in pain, limped into an alleyway. Pulling her mask off and putting it into her (soaked) satchel, she breathed in and out slowly. Now her face was visible again, her wine-colored eye set on a rather pale face with a set of freckles going down her nose and under her eyes. The right side of her face was covered by a large swathe of her dark brown hair, while the rest of it fell behind her head and hugged her neck. She had some of it tied into a strange ponytail that made one think of a pair of sharks. She took a step forward, figuring out where she was, when suddenly her leg gave out on her, and she collapsed into a puddle. *Fuck,* she thought. And everything suddenly fell away.

#### CISILA SIVETA, 19

It had been a week since they took her. A week since they killed her mother, aswell. And now Cisila was back inside her parents' house after a gruelling 48 hours of being tested on like a rat. She was sitting on the couch, and felt her hands shaking. She hadn't stopped feeling *wrong* since they put whatever it was inside of her. It felt like something else was living inside of her, and it was something she *hated.* Cisila wanted to throw herself into the ocean and never come back up. Without her mother, she had no guidance. And the week she had disappeared just had to have been the same week her college started. 

Machines and engineering had always fascinated her, and she'd chosen that college to learn how to become an engineer. And now she couldn't, because of whatever bullshit PALMER-EDEN had just put her through. She felt more frail than a stick, like a gust of wind would kill her. And...she reached up to her face and touched the right side of it. She felt the wires sticking out of the bottom of her right eye, and flinched. It felt wrong. It felt VERY wrong. She knew her eye also looked unnatural, and knew she'd have to cover it. But something like an eyepatch made her cringe, *I'm not a pirate,* she thought. Sunglasses were her next thought, but those would just be rude to wear all the time. *Especially at night,*  she leaned back. *Who wears sunglasses at night?* There was only one thing she could think to do that wouldn't really disturb her eyesight - and it was to grow her hair out and force it to cover the right of her face. But for now, sunglasses would do. She solemnly got up, looking around the house where she grew up. It was sizeable, but she couldn't keep it. She looked down at the floor of the living room and saw the dried blood on the floor. *Is it mine?* She wondered. *Or is it mom's?* She couldn't tell. IN fact, Cisila didn't WANT to be able to tell.

She looked around the empty, ghostly house. It was decorated, but sparsely. Pictures of her parents and herself were on a mantlepiece, and a large painting of her father was hung on the wall opposite the TV. It was her older sister who had painted that...she walked up to it, and looked at the signature. She sighed - her sister had disappeared a couple of years ago, after her father died. She wasn't dead, as she privately knew, but living in another state. She hadn't told her mother about this, because she *knew* her mother would have rooted the whole house up and left, just to be with another family member.

Then, Cisila studied the painting. She missed her father. He had this polite look on his face in the painting, and had a medal pinned to his shirt. She shook her head sadly. The medal was stowed away somewhere in the basement, but she didn't feel like looking for it. She could barely hold it together when she was just *in* the house, let alone looking for something her father had owned. She turned away from the painting and strode across the living room, towards an old phone sitting on a table next to the large, squishy couch she used to sleep on. Picking it up, she dialed her sister's number. She had to get the hell out of this city, at least until she felt better about herself.

The phone rang for a few seconds, before her sister picked up and said in her bored voice, "Sis? That you?"

Cisila nodded, though she forgot she wasn't talking to her sister. "Yes- it's...me. Yeah." Cisila struggled to speak. "You alright? You don't sound too good, gal." Her sister always used to fuss over Cisila. "No..." She was speaking in a loud whisper. "Mom's- mom's dead." There was a brief silence, before her sister broke it. "She's...she's what?" Her sister's tone had immediately changed, from worried to serious. "What happened?"

Cisila made some kind of noise, like a mumble, then responded: "I- can't tell you. I need to get...out of here. You..." She breathed in, "you wouldn't happen to have any- any jobs for me, would you?" She clenched one of her fists. She knew the only way she'd get out of this city was if she took some kind of backwater job, preferably out in the middle of nowhere. She wanted to make sense of this, by herself.

Her sister sighed, "Yes. I've got something. You're lucky, too..." She paused for a moment.

"You up to be a fire lookout?" She finally said.

*A fire lookout?* This job was almost *perfect* for what she wanted. Out in the middle of nowhere, nobody disturbing her. And a friend if she needed one. She felt her body calm down as she heard her sister continue, "You'll be, well, looking for fires. Obviously. In a big lookout. You'll be all alone except for some of the best radio and communication services we have out here."

Cisila continued to calm herself down, and nodded. "Alright," she mumbled. "I'll go."

She said goodbye to her sister, and put the phone down. She was going to go get her motorcycle out of the garage, get her satchel, her laptop, and everything else she needed. Whatever else she didn't need was staying right here.

Except for a couple of things, maybe...
