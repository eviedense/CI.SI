*Five, four, three, two...one.* As the rain pelted down on the city of Chicago, a hooded figure watchd a black SUV roll through the streets, standing out from the rest of the traffic by *not* standing out. The figure watched carefully, a single mechanical eye in their mask glowing a light purple as it followed the SUV.

This particular street was always a mess of neon signs, people, and in the background, crime. In between the buildings, in the grimy alleyways where diners threw out their trash, criminals hid. They weren't normal criminals, nor were they able to be stopped by the police *(Not that they did anything)*. The figure stood up, and look towards the next building. They looked as though they were wearing the battered exoskeleton of an armored suit, that weaved around their arms and legs, even piercing their chest. Thin pipes skewed in and out of their body, and wires extruded from her arms, wrapping around the metal. It was a mess. Suddenly, the figure breaks into a sprint, leaping over the gap between the two buildings. Their jump felt powerful, like a spring. As soon as they landed, with the softest *thud*, they continued to sprint, stumbling. They were clearly following the SUV.

*I've had this planned for weeks,* she thought. *But what if they take a different turn?*

Then her route would be messed up. Under the mask that only covered the left half of her face (her hair covered her right), her face was contorted into worry. The SUV was supposed to be driving right towards the largest tower in the city, owned by a pharmaceutical company named PALMER-EDEN. The place was a disgrace, she thought to herself. It was where she, Cisila, gained her powers. It was *why* she had this strange exoskeleton on her. 

She continued to follow the SUV, and it seemed to follow the path she had figured out. She slid under obstacles, leaped over AC units in her way, but still seemed inexperienced with her parkour. Everytime she vaulted over something, she stumbled, and sometimes fell to the ground - but she continued to keep up. Buildings flew past her as she picked up speed. Cisila saw the SUV turn to the left, in the middle of an intersection. *NOW!* her head screamed. The edge of the last building was fast approaching her - she'd have to jump off and use one of the street lamps to vault towards the SUV without crushing it. She felt herself tense up as the edge was suddenly there-

And she leaped. As she dove straight off the building, she saw that this street didn't have normal street lamps. She swore out loud (though nobody could hear her) and went into a dive. She'd just have to use the strange suspended lights as monkey bars until she got close enough. These street lights were a new implementation, to give the sidewalks *slightly* more space. They hung from building to building, giving the strangest feeling of a cobweb. She dove straight through them, avoiding getting tangled, and she reached up. She dragged a set of lights down with her for a couple of metres, and swung her legs back to give herself some momentum. She swung herself forward, catching each set of lights above her with her hands. Below her, people watched her, probably thinking this was some kind of trick. Cisila had taught herself to ignore them. One hand in front of the other, she was making her way towards the SUV, which had stopped at a red light for the moment. One, two, one and two. 

In a moment, she was above the SUV - and the light had turned green. She swung her legs back and forth in unison, and threw herself forward. The momentum had sent her into a backflip right towards the SUV, and she swung her legs out to make sure she landed upright. The SUV hadn't picked up enough speed to get away, but even then, her legs hit the pavement. She had to lunge forward and grab onto the trunk to stay on. Almost immediately, her shoes began to drag and she smelled the vague smell of...burning shoes. Cisila looked down and immediately realized, that obviously, her shoes wouldn't survive. She forced herself to climb up onto the top of the SUV. Lying down on her stomach, she flung her right arm out as if summoning Mjolnir, and out of her hand, coming together like a complex mechanical puzzle, complete with *clicks* and *clacks* as it put itself together, was a blade. She flipped it around in her hand so she was holding it backhanded, and stabbed it right into the windshield of the SUV. The glass shattered around the puncture, and she heard the driver slam the brakes - she'd stabbed the passenger, just as she thought.

She ripped the blade back out and let it deconstruct into her hand. She was about to get up when a bullet flew right past her. She turned back, and spotted another SUV following them, but this one had someone with a gun leaning out of the passenger side. In her hands, she constructed a throwing knife. She hadn't ever been able to construct a pistol, so a knife was the best she could do. She turned onto her back, and flung the knife towards the car. It hit the SUV's hood, puncturing it. She constructed another one and flung it once more. Her eyes went wide when she realized she'd completely missed and punctured someone else's tire. The car skidded to a stop, and the car behind it ran straight into it. Eventually, there was a pileup back there. But that was neither here nor there, because- another bullet flew by her. *Damned security,* she thought. She didn't have anywhere to go, she realized. Buildings were flying by her as the SUV took a route away from PALMER-EDEN, and she'd lost track of where they were. The rain fell down harder, pittering and pattering against the hood and roof of the SUV. Her jacket and the rest of her outfit was *drenched.* Desperately clinging onto the roof, she knew she'd have to jump off at some point.

She shook her head and clambered up onto her feet, barely keeping balance. She constructed one more knife for good measure and flung her arm out to throw it, when-

The man in the SUV took another shot and got her in the shoulder. She dropped the knife as the pain spread through her body. Then another shot whizzed right by her head, grazing the hood of her sweater. Then...a final shot hit her leg. And Cisila knew she wouldn't have another chance to get the hell *out,* as her adrenaline kicked in. She looked up, seeing the ropelights above her. She looked down at the armed man in the other SUV, and jumped up, grabbing hold of a set of lights. The SUVs quickly disappeared down the street as she climbed down to the sidewalk.

The pain had suddenly set in, and her shoulder felt like it was screaming. She leaned against the building she had climbed down on, and realized her mask was still on. She pulled her hood further up, and in pain, limped into an alleyway. Pulling her mask off and putting it into her (soaked) satchel, she breathed in and out slowly. Now her face was visible again, her wine-colored eye set on a rather pale face with a set of freckles going down her nose and under her eyes. The right side of her face was covered by a large swathe of her dark brown hair, while the rest of it fell behind her head and hugged her neck. She had some of it tied into a strange ponytail that made one think of a pair of sharks. She took a step forward, figuring out where she was, when suddenly her leg gave out on her, and she collapsed into a puddle. *Fuck,* she thought. And everything suddenly fell away.

Five years ago...

It had been a week since they took her. A week since they killed her mother, aswell. And now Cisila was back inside her parents' house after a gruelling 48 hours of being tested on like a rat. She was sitting on the couch, and felt her hands shaking. She hadn't stopped feeling *wrong* since they put whatever it was inside of her. It felt like something else was living inside of her, and it was something she *hated.* Cisila wanted to throw herself into the ocean and never come back up. Without her mother, she had no guidance. And the week she had disappeared just had to have been the same week her college started. 

Machines and engineering had always fascinated her, and she'd chosen that college to learn how to become an engineer. And now she couldn't, because of whatever bullshit PALMER-EDEN had just put her through. She felt more frail than a stick, like a gust of wind would kill her. And...she reached up to her face and touched the right side of it. She felt the wires sticking out of the bottom of her right eye, and flinched. It felt wrong. It felt VERY wrong. She knew her eye also looked unnatural, and knew she'd have to cover it. But something like an eyepatch made her cringe, *I'm not a pirate,* she thought. Sunglasses were her next thought, but those would just be rude to wear all the time. *Especially at night,*  she leaned back. *Who wears sunglasses at night?* There was only one thing she could think to do that wouldn't really disturb her eyesight - and it was to grow her hair out and force it to cover the right of her face. But for now, sunglasses would do. She solemnly got up, looking around the house where she grew up. It was sizeable, but she couldn't keep it. She looked down at the floor of the living room and saw the dried blood on the floor. *Is it mine?* She wondered. *Or is it mom's?* She couldn't tell. IN fact, Cisila didn't WANT to be able to tell.

She looked around the empty, ghostly house. It was decorated, but sparsely. Pictures of her parents and herself were on a mantlepiece, and a large painting of her father was hung on the wall opposite the TV. It was her older sister who had painted that...she walked up to it, and looked at the signature. She sighed - her sister had disappeared a couple of years ago, after her father died. She wasn't dead, as she privately knew, but living in another state. She hadn't told her mother about this, because she *knew* her mother would have rooted the whole house up and left, just to be with another family member.

Then, Cisila studied the painting. She missed her father. He had this polite look on his face in the painting, and had a medal pinned to his shirt. She shook her head sadly. The medal was stowed away somewhere in the basement, but she didn't feel like looking for it. She could barely hold it together when she was just *in* the house, let alone looking for something her father had owned. She turned away from the painting and strode across the living room, towards an old phone sitting on a table next to the large, squishy couch she used to sleep on. Picking it up, she dialed her sister's number. She had to get the hell out of this city, at least until she felt better about herself.

The phone rang for a few seconds, before her sister picked up and said in her bored voice, "Sis? That you?"

Cisila nodded, though she forgot she wasn't talking to her sister. "Yes- it's...me. Yeah." Cisila struggled to speak. "You alright? You don't sound too good, gal." Her sister always used to fuss over Cisila. "No..." She was speaking in a loud whisper. "Mom's- mom's dead." There was a brief silence, before her sister broke it. "She's...she's what?" Her sister's tone had immediately changed, from worried to serious. "What happened?"

Cisila made some kind of noise, like a mumble, then responded: "I- can't tell you. I need to get...out of here. You..." She breathed in, "you wouldn't happen to have any- any jobs for me, would you?" She clenched one of her fists. She knew the only way she'd get out of this city was if she took some kind of backwater job, preferably out in the middle of nowhere. She wanted to make sense of this, by herself.

Her sister sighed, "Yes. I've got something. You're lucky, too..." She paused for a moment.

"You up to be a fire lookout?" She finally said.

*A fire lookout?* This job was almost *perfect* for what she wanted. Out in the middle of nowhere, nobody disturbing her. And a friend if she needed one. She felt her body calm down as she heard her sister continue, "You'll be, well, looking for fires. Obviously. In a big lookout. You'll be all alone except for some of the best radio and communication services we have out here."

Cisila continued to calm herself down, and nodded. "Alright," she mumbled. "I'll go."

She said goodbye to her sister, and put the phone down. She was going to go get her motorcycle out of the garage, get her satchel, her laptop, and everything else she needed. Whatever else she didn't need was staying right here.

Except for a couple of things, maybe...

Cisila woke up, still lying in the puddle. The puddle was now dyed a deep red, from her blood. She didn't want to move at all, nervous that she might do more damage to herself. She breathed in, and breathed out, rolling herself onto her back. It was still raining, as raindrops fell on her face. Her clothes were still drenched- though her exoskeleton had disappeared. She blinked a couple times, and became aware of the ringing in her eyes. She couldn't feel the injuries, nor could she feel *anything*. She was just lying there.

She lifted her hand into the air and flexed her fingers, and began to feel how sore she was. She grumbled to herself and let her arm fall back to her side. She heard something and immediately felt more awake. *One of those guys? Come here to finish me?* On impulse, her blade immediately constructed itself in her hand, and she attempted to spring up. Instead of jumping right up onto her feet, she collapsed again and had to use her sword as a crutch. Cisila looked around, and saw a figure approaching. She could feel her heartrate increase, as the person came nearer. *Who was it? Am I about to-* Suddenly, the person clicked on a flashlight right at Cisila.

Cisila breathed a sigh of relief, it was *not* someone trying to kill her. The person approached her, and knelt beside her. They were wearing a white hoodie, accentuated by red. They sighed, but Cisila couldn't see their expression in the darkness. "You...really need to stop doing this." Cisila rolled her eyes, *Of course.* she thought. That was always their first words whenever something like this happened. The only thing Cisila saw that indicated any expression under their hood were their lips twitching. "Don't give me that. I'm trying to help you, you know." Yeah, right. Cisila slumped back against the alley wall, and sighed. She finally spoke, "If you were trying to help me, you'd just let me do what I want." They pulled their hood down- and Cisila immediately felt as though she was being pierced by their eyes - those strangely bright green eyes, like they were almost glowing. Dani made eye contact with her, "If I let you do what you wanted, you'd end up like this every single night. And I'd have to wander around looking for you...*every. Night.* Think about that for a second," They paused for a moment, rubbing their forehead. Cisila broke the eye contact and instead staring at the snake tattoo running down their cheek, and slinked down their neck.  It was a weird tattoo, and Cisila always wondered what it was supposed to mean. She slowly looked back up and met Dani's eyes again, her expression attempting to be blank. "...I don't need you to look for me." Dani snorted, and responded slyly, "You're bleeding out. You would've died." And they were right. Begrudgingly, she muttered, "Mmm...right. Just- get me out of here." Dani got up and helped Cisila up, but before they took their first step, they said, "You better tell me what you were doing, though."

Cisila rolled her eyes again. As if.

An hour later, Dani led her into the interior of an old, large lighthouse on the coast of Lake Michigan. The inside was littered was a bunch of mish-mashed pieces of old furniture, and a workshop hidden away in the dark. It was pretty damp, but it was their second home. Cisila would hide here in case she got injured, as was the case in the moment. Dani helped Cisila sit down in a moth-eaten, squishy armchair, and they started to look at Cisila's wounds. "Jesus," they started. "Did you get shot?"

She bedgrudgingly nodded. She felt like she could've fought back, had she had her own firearm. Maybe then she wouldn't be hurting like a bitch right now. "I need a knife," Dani mumbled. Cisila raised an eyebrow, slightly concerned. "...For the bullets." They said. "I need to get the bullets out." Oh. That made sense. She held her hand up and constructed one of her knives in the palm of her hand, and gave it to Dani. They flipped it around in their hands, examining it. "Looks professional...how long did it take you to make this one?" Cisila thought back... "Three weeks of work. Just for a...knife." She leaned back, and immediately felt a wave of disappointment in herself. She never had to think *that* hard about materials whenever she used to draw up designs for something, and was able to make them easier - and she would still do that, but she didn't *have* supplies. She didn't have the money to keep up on parts, and with her ability, she shouldn't have to. So she resentfully used the ability, learning how it worked over a course of four years. *FOUR.* And she still took months to make something. She shook her head, "I was never happy with it." Dani scoffed - "I really, sincerely don't get why you treat yourself like this." They held the knife up. "You created this out of literal nothing. How can you not be happy with it?" Of course. Dani didn't get it. Cisila rested her head against her hand, and mumbled, "Can you just...get this over with...please?"

And then, another painful hour later, now wrapped up in bandages, Cisila was sipping a cup of tea. She was still in the armchair. Dani had disappeared up the stairs of the lighthouse, and was probably messing around in their room at the top. Cisila had no idea if she actually lived up there, or if it was their hideout, like Cisila used the place. They did own the lighthouse, after all. It was their property, and they just let Cisila use it. Ever since she'd met Dani, they'd worked really well together (for the most part).

It was just...they led some kind of (she thought for a moment, trying to find the right word) brotherhood. She never understood why Dani led it, or why it was even a thing. She always worked alone, and it usually went well for her. She shook her head to herself, *was it really the best idea, though?* She quickly pushed that thought out and sipped her tea again.

Three years ago...

Cisila kicked down the door to an old house in the outskirts of the city, and drove her blade straight through the first thug in the doorway. She shoved him against the wall, pulled her blade out and walked down the hallway. Stealth was *not* her intention here. Rounding another corner, she almost slammed right into another thug. He stepped back in shock, (*fear*, she noticed. The mask was doing its job.) and for a second, he didn't do anything. She was about to stab him, but her reaction time wasn't good enough. The thug managed to swing one of his fists before Cisila could even do anything - she could barely get out of the way before it hit her. She dropped her blade, grabbed his arm, and felt a memory flash through her head. In one swift motion, she broke the thug's arm, grabbed his chest, and slammed him to the floor. *Dad would've loved that.* She scopped up her blade and stepped over the thug, who was writhing in pain. She didn't care whether they lived or died, as long as she could stop them. 

*What are you even stopping them for?*, her mind whispered. They were criminals...buying stuff off the black market for PALMER-EDEN. She was going to cut off every goddamned tendril that connected to PALMER-EDEN. She was now moving automatically, her thoughts focused on that *company.* She rounded another corner, *I'll make them pay I'll make them pay I'll make them pay*, her mind whined. As she rounded the corner, she had absolutely no time to react when-

She felt someone bash what felt like a brick against the back of her head. She was still for a moment, and then stumbled to the ground and let go of her blade - it clattered to the floor. She suddenly felt the pain. The pain. Jesus, it HURT. She grabbed hold of the back of her head and felt blood trickle through her fingers. *FUCK,* she screamed internally. She whirled around and attempted to grab her blade, but felt her vision going blurry. Everything had gone blurry - the buzzing in her ears became more prominent. She HAD to get up. She *had* to stop them, no matter what they would do to her. She'd-

And then the man who had attacked her fell to the floor, and through her blurry vision, she noticed...he'd lost his head. Her eyes went wide. *Did I do that? How did I...* but her question was quickly answered. This was where Cisila first met Dani. It was the exact same situation, almost - Dani had to rescue an injured Cisila. But she still had no idea why she had done it in the first place.

Dani grabbed Cisila by her collar, and dragged her back out of the house. "You idiot." She'd remember them saying, "I've seen you on the news- you have to stop." Oh. The news. 

Cisila mumbled, "Didn't...mean to do...any of that." Especially the fire. She was trying to stop a gang from selling illegal weapons, but ended up setting an entire harbour ablaze. Dani audibly sighed, "I know. I'm trying to help you. But I need to get you out of here." Cisila struggled, and grunted. "Can't- got to...stop- them." Dani tugged Cisila out of the old house, and set her down against one of the walls, kneeling in front of her and pulling some medical supplies out of their satchel. "Your head's bleeding. You were hit with a *brick.* You can't." Cisila shook her head. She didn't need help. She NEVER needed help, especially from some stranger who might've probably ripped someone's head off.

But there was no stopping Dani- and after, they talked. Dani learned of Cisila's story, and invited her to work with their...brotherhood. Or whatever the hell it was. 
And so started Cisila's only relationship that actually mattered. It was like a master, and a student. Vaguely. It really didn't matter.

She'd gotten back home at around 5 in the morning, and fainted in her bed. Then, when her alarm went off ( at *6*, she remembered. Christ.) she reluctantly got out of bed, still dead tired, and started getting ready for the day. She emptied her satchel, and put the mask down on her bed. Her room was really small and there was nowhere to hide the things that V (Dani had given her that name) used in the night. Except for one place. She picked the mask up, got down on her hands and knees, and lifted up one of the floorboards. There was a decent space beneath the floor for her to hide something - and, if she emptied it, she bet she could squeeze herself in there. Barely. She put the mask in the space under the floorboard, and dropped the floorboard back on it. She got up, stretched (she felt her spine crack- she'd been sitting for too long) and realized she was still wearing her stupid vigilante outfit. A dark blue hoodie, a leather jacket, and her most worn pair of cargo pants - plus some old combat boots (*Her dad's...*). She quickly got her usual outfit on- her favourite purple shirt, a light grey pair of cargo pants. She pulled on a pair of socks, and picked up a necklace off her bedside table. Holding it up to the light, the blue sapphire glinted in what little light there was. She pulled it on and tried not to give it another thought, and stepped out of her room.
