#### Cisila J. Siveta, 26
#### November 30th, 2035

Cisila gently closed the hood of the white Mazda RX-7 FC3S, making sure it was shut tight. The dim garage looked less inviting than usual, the rain outside pounding down on the roof. The FC sat in the middle of the garage, now mostly unused. Cisila stared at its windshield, regretting having not been able to use it for the past couple of months. Its pop-up headlights were flush with the hood of the car, and she noticed there was a thin, *thin* layer of dust on the car. She'd forgotten to pull the tarp over it. *Man.* She thought, sliding her hand across the hood, wiping the dust away. Sighing to herself, Cisila tried to think of what she could do about this. She could wash the car here, or take it out. But she was uncertain of whether or not she wanted to take it for a drive. But seeing Stephanie drive that Nissan...it did give her some sense of feeling again. She had near perfect control of the car for what she wanted to use it for. But there was one thing Stephanie couldn't quite do that Cisila *could.* And that was drift competently. This white FC with the purple trim...it was the perfect drift machine that was currently in Chicago. The simple cosmetic modifications to make the bumper sharper and lower to the ground, and other parts to make a more rigid and angular appearance, coupled with the modified suspension, engine parts and tires. The rear wheel drive compared to the Nissan Skyline's all wheel drive made it much easier to drift. But Cisila hadn't practiced in a while...maybe it *was* time to go up Skeller Pass again and give the old girl a spin. Cisila pulled her phone out of her pocket and called Lyla, lifting her phone up to her ear. "Hey...what's up?" Lyla said as the call started. "I'm up at the lighthouse..." Cisila began, putting her free hand in her pocket, "Just thought I'd let you know I'm taking the FC out for a drive." She walked around the car, watching it. "Alright." Lyla replied, sounding tired. "Well, call me when you get back. Should note, though..." She trailed off. "Should know what?" Cisila asked. "Steph's out." Lyla muttered, "Took her car. You might run into her." Oh. Great. Cisila knew how much Stephanie liked to use Skeller Pass as a place to drive alone. There was a pretty high chance she'd run into Stephanie...and Stephanie had no idea Cisila owned an FC. What could happen? \
Maybe nothing would happen. It probably didn't matter, anyways. "Right-o." Cisila finally responded, opening the door to the RX-7 FC. "I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye." She said, and Lyla replied with a goodnight to her, hanging up. Cisila put her phone away and stepped into the car, slamming the door shut as she did. The steering wheel and pedals, just like the Nissan, were on the right-hand side of the car. It was straight from Japan. *Okay.* She thought, sliding her hands onto the leather steering wheel. It was sturdy, and the black leather felt as nice as it always did. The interior, unlike the exterior, was a deep purple. Her favourite colour. The seats, the inside of the doors...everything she could fit it into without making it look ridiculous. The exterior was primarily white, with a purple trim running along the bottom sides of the car, aswell as the bottom of the front and rear bumpers. The tires' rims were a very deep purple, nearly black. From her pocket, Cisila pulled out her keyring and found the ignition key. *Alright.* She thought, leaning back into the seat. The interior of the car felt warm and inviting. Sliding the key into the ignition, she felt the key resist her slightly as the metal uncomfortably shunted and scraped against the sides of the keyhole. Cisila twisted the key and the engine roared to life. It was a 13B rotary engine, the same as the stock engine, but Cisila had swapped out a lot of its parts in order to make the rotary engine less tempermental than they were known to be. Most notably swapped out was the turbocharger, which had been replaced by a higher quality and more powerful one, giving the engine more of a boost, letting the car gain more speed on straightaways. "Alright." Cisila said out loud, to nobody in particular. She patted the wheel with one of her hands, "Let's give you a stretch." She settled her feet down on the pedals, her left settled on the clutch to the far left, and her right on the gas. Pulling out her phone to open the garage door, she used her other hand to flick on the headlights, which popped up in place, as if the car was opening its eyes after a long slumber. The garage door began to slide open, screeching and squeaking as it did, and Cisila put her phone away, pulling her seatbelt on. Easing her foot down onto the gas pedal, the Mazda inched towards the garage door before Cisila pushed the gas pedal down further. The car sped up and exited the garage, jostling as the wheels landed on the slightly lower and uneven dirt road connecting the garage to the main road ahead. The rain immediately began pouring down onto the car and Cisila couldn't even tell when the dust disappeared...it was just *gone.* Turning on the windshield wipers, Cisila led the car down the empty dirt road, its bright lights illuminating the path ahead. Everything around her was pitch black, even the sky...the dark clouds blocked out the stars and the moon. *Wish it was a little clearer, but...I don't care that much.* She thought as she pulled the car out onto the road and immediately pushed the gas pedal as far down as it would go. The rear wheels resisted for a second, slipping, before the car shot forward and Cisila latched onto the stick shift and pulled it as she noticed the RPM getting higher and higher, the car's engine . It shifted the car into second gear with a soft, sturdy *thunk.* She took a left towards Skeller Pass, the same exact route Stephanie had taken in the R32 to catch the Crow, and subsequently escape from the Dragons.

As the RX-7 FC reached the top of the mountain and hurtled past the abandoned gas station hidden in the night, something in the rearview mirror glinted. *Huh?* Cisila looked up at the mirror, only to see a pair of white headlights shining behind her, shining pinpricks of light through the sheets of rain pouring down on the road. The roar of the car's engine grew louder and stronger as the headlights grew larger, the car gaining on Cisila's FC. Hidden in the darkness, Cisila couldn't see the driver, or even the car itself. That meant it was a black car, and the engine...Cisila recognized the distinct roar as a Nissan RB26DETT. An ominous chill that she couldn't stop made its way up her spine. It was unnatural, akin to hearing someone play an organ in a massive, empty building. *There's no way...* She thought, easing her foot down on the gas, glancing once more at the Nissan Skyline GT-R BNR32 behind her. Stephanie's GT-R, gaining on her rapidly. *Seems like she wants to play.* There was no way Stephanie could know that the driver was Cisila. As the rotary engine whirred harder, the FC sped up and Cisila thunked the stick shfit into the next gear. The way this was going, Stephanie might challenge Cisila to impromptu *t≈çge* on Skeller Pass, a mountain race. *I don't think she knows what she's about to get into. If that's actually her...* As the rain poured down harder, the two cars kicked up a watery mist behind them as their tires skidded through the rain. Cisila felt the downhill incline begin, and pushed the gas pedal to the floor. The RPM immediately shot up and Cisila advanced the car into its next and final gear, fifth. The speedometer was rising slowly, now at about 165 km/h as the road opened up slightly. Cisila pulled the car to the right, prepared for the first sharp hairpin turn. The GT-R followed behind her, still gaining on her. The engine roared behind Cisila as the front bumper of the R32 got dangerously close to the rear bumper of the FC, and Cisila glanced at the rearview mirror, wondering *what* Stephanie was doing. Spotting Stephanie in the driver's seat, Cisila's left eye twitched. It *was* her and she looked serious. The first turn was approaching, and fast, so if Stephanie didn't get out of the way, the rear bumper of the FC was going to slam into the front end of the R32, sending both out of control. But just as Cisila was about to abandon her move, the GT-R backed off, its brakes screeching as its brake lights shone bright red behind it, illuminating the curtains of rain behind the car. *That's it. Good.* Cisila thought as the straightaway suddenly ended in a corner, and she stamped her right foot down on the brakes, the heel against the gas continuing to depress it, acting as a manual ABS (assisted braking system). Pulling the stick-shift back with her left hand, Cisila heard the brakes metallically shriek as the calipers clamped down on the discs, glowing a hot orange before she let off the brake, stamping her left foot down on the clutch pedal, before lifting it off as fast as she could. Keeping her right foot on the gas to regulate the power moving through the car as she whipped the wheel to the right, Cisila turned the front of the car inwards into a four wheel drift. The clutch kick she'd performed sent the car sideways, the front bumper getting uncomfortably close to the inner guardrail as she pulled the wheel to the left around the hairpin turn. She continued to downshift the car with her left hand on the stick-shift, while the rear wheels kicked up a thick mist of water in the FC's wake. Glancing up at the rearview mirror again whilst keeping a steady grip on the wheel, Cisila wasn't surprised to see the R32 right behind her, kicking up a cloud of watery mist in its own wake. Stephanie was using its all-wheel-drive and braking power to pull the car around the turn without drifting. Its headlights shone through the FC's interior, illuminating Cisila briefly before the turn opened back up into a straightaway and she straightened out the car, slamming back down on the gas. The car rocketed forward, but the R32 easily kept up, its acceleration far superior to the FC.

*Jesus, that thing can keep up.* Cisila thought, carefully watching the mirror to make sure Steph didn't try anything on the straightaway. *I should've known.* She had been in the car, after all, and had seen what Stephanie could do in it. The next turn, a less sharp left turn, was coming up fast. It was a high speed corner that Cisila could easily drift through, creating a gap between the GT-R and the FC, as she knew that the GT-R R32 didn't do well in high speed corners, and the only reason it had kept up in the last one was because it was *the* low-speed hairpin car of the 1990s. "Let's see if you can keep up with *this*..." Cisila muttered, stamping down on the brake with her right foot, its heel on the gas once more as the left turn appeared, before she lifted her foot off to focus on the drift. Slamming her left down on the clutch and quickly lifting off, it disengaged the rear wheels for a brief moment to get the car sideways, the bumper of the FC getting dangerously close to the inner guardrail as the drift sustained in tandem speed the FC had already gained. The GT-R fought the corner behind her, still close enough to be a threat. Water kicked up in hazy plumes beneath the tires of both cars as the rain fell harder and harder, before Cisila pulled the car back into its normal orientation and pushed down on the gas once more, lifting her foot off the brake and advancing the car's gears. She heard the exhaust pop as she exited the drift, and the car rocketed ahead of the R32, but not for long. Now there was a long straightaway that would likely let Stephanie get ahead...but past it was an intense hairpin turn that would surely force Stephanie to drift, and Cisila knew she wasn't keen to do it. Stephanie *could* do it, she also knew, which made Cisila's next move harder. Did she keep the inside, or should she let the R32 ahead? It was unlikely that she would be able to get past it again once it got ahead, so Cisila shook her head and pulled the stick shift into the next gear. She would stay ahead, as long as she could. Glancing at the rearview mirror, she spotted the R32 moving to the outside line. *What is she doing?* Stephanie knew there was a sharp left turn this way, and the outside line was the complete wrong way to go. The spot where Cisila knew she had to brake was rapidly approaching, but the R32 pulled to the side and began to pass the FC. *"What the hell are you doing...?!"* Cisila hissed, stamping down on the brakes, their metal screeching echoing through the trees and the rain. The R32 continued ahead, without braking. Her FC now behind it, Cisila saw that its four distinct tail lights didn't light up. Stephanie needed to stop, or else she would- \
But the rear end of the black GT-R suddenly swung to the left, its wheels skidding across the wet road, and then, using the intertia it had gained, it swung to the right, whipping around the corner. Cisila performed the same drift technique she had done twice already, which had been deeply embedded in her muscle memory by this point, watching the road ahead. It was much slower than what Stephanie had just done. *What the everloving HELL was that?* Cisila wondered, her mind buzzing with theories. She had never *seen* a car do that before...use its inertia to avoid braking for a drift? What had Stephanie been *doing?* As Cisila straightened the FC out, she saw that the R32 didn't pull as far ahead as she anticipated. She could still catch up to it, seeing its four circular tail lights not far ahead of her. *Well, this is a long straightaway...* Cisila thought, reaching her free hand towards a toggle switch with a cover locking it in. Flicking the cover up, Cisila pushed the switch forward, clicking it into place. *Hope this works. I haven't tested it.* She thought, a pang of nervousness shooting up her spine as she lifted her hand away. As the switch flicked forward, Cisila immediately felt the power from the nitrous kick in, hurtling the car forward and pushing Cisila back into her seat. Pulling the car to the side of the R32, the RX-7 FC pulled up next to the black car, the N2O powerful enough to beat the R32's acceleration. *Let's see how you deal with this.* Cisila thought, flicking the switch back and shutting the cover back over it. The next turn came up, a right turn that Cisila could drift through, *if* Stephanie drifted aswell. But she didn't. Cisila looked to the side, only to see Stephanie staring at her, her hands on the wheel, pulling it to the right as hard as she could, just like Cisila was. They made eye contact, and through the rain and the darkness, Cisila could barely pick out Stephanie's ghostly pale face, her eyes hidden behind her dark sunglasses. Her eyebrows were raised high in surprise, her mouth was open in shock. She must've been in disbelief- however, now was *not* the time to think about it. Cisila was on the inside of the turn and the FC's bumper was getting closer and closer to the inner guardrail as the two cars turned harder and harder. The R32 was slightly understeering, and Stephanie had to compensate by braking, allowing the FC to pull ahead. Cisila eased her foot down on the gas and the white Mazda pulled ahead as the corner straightened out. Despite being ahead, the rigid and boxy R32 began to pull ahead, next to Cisila, its acceleration still unmatched. Cisila had already used the can of nitrous that she'd installed in the car, which meant she would just have to match the GT-R's power in the corners. As the two cars hurtled further down the mountain, fighting through the rain and the sharp corners, neither pulled ahead of the other. On the exit of the corners, the Nissan Skyline GT-R pulled ahead, but the Mazda RX-7 FC caught up to it in the corners, Cisila forcing it to drift as hard as it could. The sounds of the inline six engine of the R32 and the 13B rotary engine of the RX-7 echoed through the mountains and down the road, the R32 sounding like a roaring monster, but not deep and bellowing, rather light and floaty, yet still extremely menacing interspersed with the fluttering and whirring of its twin turbochargers. The RX-7 in constrast sounded like a cacophony of hornets, loudly buzzing in between the flutters of its own turbocharger. Yet despite Cisila's best efforts, the R32 remained ahead. The trick Stephanie had pulled by drifting without braking had led to a gap that she couldn't close, and as Cisila pulled the wheel to the left and the right, her eyebrows furrowed in annoyance as she watched the tail lights of the GT-R disappear around the corner, only for her to turn the corner and spot the tail lights even further away. No matter how close she got, the GT-R pulled away. Stephanie understood how to handle it, and that combined with its all-wheel-drive led to Cisila being left behind. But the next few turns weren't the R32's optimal turns, which were low speed sharp hairpin turns. They were high speed corners in which Cisila could easily catch up to the R32 and pass it if she was lucky enough. Whether Stephanie knew that Cisila was going to try this or not, it was still worth a go. She even had a trick up her sleeve to disorient Stephanie...

*"Remember, whenever someone tries to challenge you-" Catania said, putting her hands on Cisila's shoulders. "You let them. Even if your car is underpowered- even if theirs is a hyper car...you let them." But Cisila didn't understand why. When she asked, Cat lifted her hands off her shoulders and led her into the garage of their parents' house. Their mother wasn't home that day. "It's certain they'll pass you if your car is better, but, these usually happen at night, correct?" Cat began, walking over to her 1970 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 in the garage. "And you need headlights to see..." Cisila followed her, still confused. "Turn 'em off, and you'll practically disappear into the night. It's dangerous, but it'll disorient your opponent enough to probably make them think that you conceded, crashed, or otherwise stopped. It's not a guarantee, but when it works, it's like a charm." Cat seemed confident in her explanation. Doubtful, Cisila looked over the Camaro, frowning. "Have you done it before?" She asked. Cat nodded, "Once. In Dad's old car, actually. I crashed it, he wasn't happy." she sighed. "Boy, was he stressed out about the cost of repairs." Their father had owned a MK5 2019 Toyota GR Supra, which had been a top of the line Toyota model at the time, and still was. Cat was its owner after their father passed, but this Camaro was the car she drove every day. In Montana, the Siveta's GR Supra was considered a ghost by the locals, despite being driven by Cat. The "Spectre of Whitefish" was the name among local street racers, as not only did the Siveta family live in Whitefish, the Supra was bright white. It only had one decal, above the rear right tire, in a simple lower-case black font, reading "ghost". But as Cisila's mind lingered on the Supra, she looked over the Camaro, and considered the idea. If she ever did get her hands on a car, maybe she'd give it a go.*

And now was the best time. Now, she would trick Stephanie. Back in the present, in the moment, Cisila reached out and flipped the switch for the headlights. The bright lights flooding ahead and illuminating the rear of the R32 and the wet road ahead disappeared, and the pop-up headlights retracted into the hood. The only thing she could see ahead of her were the R32's four distinct circular tail lights, and its own headlights shining ahead. Stephanie looked into her rearview mirror, only to see nothing behind her. Worry immediately overtook her as she tried desperately to see if Cisila was still behind her, but the RX-7 had faded into the darkness and the rain. "Wait- what...?!" She sputtered, as she pulled around another corner, but not as hard as she had been before. If Cisila had crashed, she needed to turn around, *now.* Easing off the left turn more and more, Stephanie slowly opened a gap on the inside line as she began to slow down. But just as she was about to stamp on the brakes...two bright beams of light flared back on on her left, the inside of the corner. Stephanie's mouth opened in shock, her eyes wide in surprise as she realized what had just happened. \
Cisila was pulling the steering wheel of the RX-7 as hard as she could to the left, using the disorientation to her immense advantage. Now, she was pulling through on the inside of the corner, while Stephanie was left on the outside, not only on the slower racing line, but now much slower as she had stamped on the brakes, thinking Cisila needed help. Pulling out of the corner, Cisila recognized they only had a few turns left before the end of the mountain. If she wanted to beat Stephanie at her own game, she'd have to keep ahead. The white RX-7 was side-by-side with the black R32, their headlights beaming through the rain. However, from Stephanie's point of view, she too still had a chance to win. "Not this time, Cis...!" She hissed, slamming her foot down on the gas and pulling the stick-shift into the next gear. She was starting to get over-excited, her heart beating out of her chest. "Starting from second gear out of this corner, I can pull ahead!" She proclaimed, though Stephanie knew Cisila couldn't hear her. "The acceleration is overwhelming-" Her grip on the steering wheel tightened as the pedal hit the floor. "Its cornering power is unmatched..." As the next corner approached, Stephanie pulled the wheel to the right. "You can't beat me!" She hissed as she had the inside line, while Cisila decided to pull in behind her and drift rather than slow down on the outside line. This was a minor annoyance for Cisila. As the corner straightened out, the RX-7's sustained speed allowed it to catch up to the R32, and the two began to line up once more, side-by-side. Both knew the next corner would be necessary to drift through, but in a situation like this? Stephanie didn't want to. Cisila didn't want to, either, for risk of slamming into Stephanie. But as the corner appeared through the rain, Cisila kicked her foot down on the clutch, her right foot on the brake, its heel on the gas, whilst her hands spun the wheel as hard as they could...and then, so too did Stephanie. At the same time, the two cars tilted inwards and sent plumes of watery mist up behind them as they drifted around the left hairpin turn, Cisila's RX-7 on the inside, and Stephanie's R32 on the outside. As they exited the corner, the downhill opened up, barreling both cars towards the final corner before the mountain pass ended. "Come on. Come *on.*" Stephanie begged the car, pushing the gas down as far as it would go, shifting through the transmission with her left hand. The bumper of the R32 pulled just ahead of the RX-7 as both cars sped down the incline, and Stephanie knew what she had to do if she wanted to win. In the RX-7, Cisila was just as desperate, her foot all the way down on the gas. But before she could even formulate a plan to get into the inside line...it happened again. \
Stephanie whipped the wheel to the left, pulling the handbrake which disengaged the rear wheels, letting the car slide to the left, kicking up a thick mist of water droplets. She shoved the handbrake back into place before spinning the wheel the other way, sliding the car to the right. "Shit-!" Cisila sputtered, performing a clutch kick and a heel-toe brake to get around the final corner. Stephanie had gotten ahead by doing that...that *thing* again. She watched in disbelief as the R32 drifted around the corner much faster than Cisila could in her RX-7. Rounding the final corner and seeing the street lights lining the sides of the road, Cisila immediately put her left foot on the brake and down-shifted through the cars' gears with the stick shift until she was back at the speed limit. Stephanie did this aswell, and Cisila followed her for a couple more minutes along the road. At the bottom of the mountain, unlike the route through it, were rows of street lights illuminating the road, though there were still next to no cars. Stephanie's R32 pulled into the gas station at the bottom of this end of the mountain. Cisila pulled the RX-7 into the gas station aswell, and rolled it up next to the R32, under a canopy. Cisila turned the ignition off and pushed open the driver side door, before stepping out. The heavy rain battered against the metal canopy, washing down on the edges, droplets pouring off. It was just as dark as when Cisila left, the only lights coming from the street lights at the bottom of the mountain and the dim gas station. With a *thunk*, Stephanie exited her R32 and walked around the hood to Cisila. Cisila sat on the hood of the RX-7, pulling out her pack of cigarettes and a lighter. Stephanie pulled her sunglasses off and shoved them into the collar of her shirt beneath her jacket. "I- I'm so..." She stuttered, motioning with her hands at Cisila. "...Shocked?" Cisila finished for her, lighting a cigarette. "I didn't know you had an FC..." Stephanie replied, rubbing her chin. "It's so...well maintained, too." She stared at the RX-7 for a brief moment, shaking her head. "Why didn't you tell me?" Stephanie asked, crossing her arms, looking at Cisila judgmentally. Her silver eyes glistened with the light from the gas station. "Didn't have a chance..." Cisila responded, smoking quietly. "Had we not met over a corpse, I probably would've brought it up. But considering what happened..." She shrugged, sighing. It wasn't something she liked to think about. "Oh..." Stephanie replied, rubbing her chin again. "Yeah, I guess so..." She lifted her arms over her head and stretched, leaning back. After stretching, she continued. "Nearly gave me a heart attack when you turned off your headlights- what *was* that for?" \
Cisila snorted, smiling. "It's a thing my sister taught me. And it seemed to have worked, y'know." She said gleefully, looking over at the Nissan Skyline GT-R, "You must've been *terrified* until I turned them back on. Sorry about that." She added, looking back at Stephanie. "All's fair on the street..." Stephanie sighed, shrugging. "Until I saw it was you, I thought you were gonna do something like knock the GT-R off course." She paused, brow furrowing. "Hang on." She said, tilting her head. "Did you know that was me?" Cisila rolled her eyes and nodded, taking another puff of smoke. "Course. Hard not to recognise the RB26 and the midnight black paint." Stephanie sighed again, and nodded, shutting her eyes for a moment. "Shoulda known." She leaned against one of the metal poles of the canopy, before pulling her sunglasses back on. *Her eyes must hurt...* Cisila thought, watching her push the sunglasses up her nose. Stephanie spoke up again, "Say, what did you *do* to that thing to have it keep up with the acceleration? Usually I pull ahead faster, but that..." she trailed off, eyeing the hood of the car. "Just some nitrous in the back for a boost, aswell as some tuning...think I got the engine to around 400 horsepower. Don't remember the specifics." Cisila replied, sliding off the hood. "I'm a mechanic. Or at least...I wanted to be. This car and the...the, well-" she paused, "my other car...are the last remnants of that career." Cisila frowned, and put her cigarette out as she finished the sentence. "...Other car?" Stephanie prodded. Cisila shook her head, "Just a GR Supra...it was my dad's. I don't like using it." \
"You're *kidding.*" Stephanie wheezed, leaning back against the pole. "An FC *and* a MK5 Supra? The Supra's kinda old by this point, but paired with an FC? You're more into cars than I am." She sputtered, surprised. "All I ever wanted was this old girl..." Walking over to the GT-R R32, Stephanie patted its hood. "Can I see the Supra, actually? I saw you had a garage at the Lighthouse, but I didn't know it was actually for cars." She added, opening the door to her R32. Cisila pursed her lips and looked down at her feet, thinking for a moment. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have a look at the Supra. Looking back up, she nodded, and quickly made her way over to the driver's side of the RX-7. "I'll meet you there." She said, climbing in. Stephanie nodded back and climbed into her car, and the two pulled out of the gas station.
