Cisila gently closed the hood of the white Mazda RX-7 FC3S, making sure it was shut tight. The dim garage looked less inviting than usual, the rain outside pounding down on the roof. The FC sat in the middle of the garage, now mostly unused. Cisila stared at its windshield, regretting having not been able to use it for the past couple of months. Its pop-up headlights were flush with the hood of the car, and she noticed there was a thin, *thin* layer of dust on the car. She'd forgotten to pull the tarp over it. *Man.* She thought, sliding her hand across the hood, wiping the dust away. Sighing to herself, Cisila tried to think of what she could do about this. She could wash the car here, or take it out. But she was uncertain of whether or not she wanted to take it for a drive. But seeing Stephanie drive that Nissan...it did give her some sense of feeling again. She had near perfect control of the car for what she wanted to use it for. But there was one thing Stephanie couldn't quite do that Cisila *could.* And that was drift competently. This white FC with the purple trim...it was the perfect drift machine that was currently in Chicago. The simple cosmetic modifications to make the bumper lower to the ground, and other parts to make a more rigid and angular appearance, coupled with the modified suspension, engine parts and tires. The rear wheel drive compared to the Nissan Skyline's all wheel drive made it much easier to drift. But Cisila hadn't practiced in a while...maybe it *was* time to go up Skeller Pass again and give the old girl a spin. Cisila pulled her phone out of her pocket and called Lyla, lifting her phone up to her ear. "Hey...what's up?" Lyla said as the call started. "I'm up at the lighthouse..." Cisila began, putting her free hand in her pocket, "Just thought I'd let you know I'm taking the FC out for a drive." She walked around the car, watching it. "Alright." Lyla replied, sounding tired. "Well, call me when you get back. Should note, though..." She trailed off. "Should know what?" Cisila asked. "Steph's out." Lyla muttered, "Took her car. You might run into her." Oh. Great. Cisila knew how much Stephanie liked to use Skeller Pass as a place to drive alone. There was a pretty high chance she'd run into Stephanie...and Stephanie had no idea Cisila owned an FC. What would happen? \
Maybe it wouldn't happen. It probably didn't matter, anyways. "Right-o." Cisila finally responded, opening the door to the RX-7 FC. "I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye." She said, and Lyla said goodbye to her aswell. Cisila put her phone away and stepped into the car, slamming the door shut as she did. The steering wheel and pedals, just like the Nissan, were on the right-hand side of the car. It was straight from Japan. *Okay.* She thought, sliding her hands onto the leather steering wheel. It was sturdy, and the black leather felt as nice as it always did. The interior, unlike the exterior, was a deep purple. Her favourite colour. The seats, the inside of the doors...everything she could fit it into without making it look ridiculous. The exterior was primarily white, with a purple trim running along the bottom sides of the car, aswell as the bottom of the front and rear bumpers. The tires' rims were a very deep purple, nearly black. From her pocket, Cisila pulled out her keyring and found the ignition key. *Alright.* She thought, leaning back into the seat. The interior of the car felt warm and inviting. Sliding the key into the ignition, she felt the key resist her slightly as the metal uncomfortably shunted and scraped against the sides of the keyhole. Cisila twisted the key and the engine roared to life. It was a 13B rotary engine, the same as the stock engine, but Cisila had swapped out a lot of its parts in order to make the rotary engine less tempermental than they were known to be. Most notably swapped out was the turbocharger, which had been replaced by a higher quality and more powerful one, giving the engine more of a boost, letting the car gain more speed on straightaways. "Alright." Cisila said out loud, to nobody in particular. She patted the wheel with one of her hands, "Let's give you a stretch." She settled her feet down on the pedals, her left settled on the clutch to the far left, and her right on the gas. Pulling out her phone to open the garage door, she used her other hand to flick on the headlights, which popped up in place, as if the car was opening its eyes after a long slumber. The garage door began to slide open, screeching and squeaking as it did, and Cisila put her phone away, pulling her seatbelt on. Easing her foot down onto the gas pedal, the Mazda inched towards the garage door before Cisila pushed the gas pedal down further. The car sped up and exited the garage, jostling as the wheels landed on the slightly lower and uneven dirt road connecting the garage to the main road ahead. The rain immediately began pouring down onto the car and Cisila couldn't even tell when the dust disappeared...it was just *gone.* Turning on the windshield wipers, Cisila led the car down the empty dirt road, its bright lights illuminating the path ahead. Everything around her was pitch black, even the sky...the dark clouds blocked out the stars and the moon. *Wish it was a little clearer, but...I don't care that much.* She thought as she pulled the car out onto the road and immediately pushed the gas pedal as far down as it would go. The rear wheels resisted for a second, slipping, before the car shot forward and Cisila latched onto the stick shift and pulled it as she noticed the RPM getting higher and higher, the car's engine . It shifted the car into second gear with a soft, sturdy *thunk.* She took a left towards Skeller Pass, the same exact route Stephanie had taken in the R32 to catch the Crow, and subsequently escape from the Dragons.
