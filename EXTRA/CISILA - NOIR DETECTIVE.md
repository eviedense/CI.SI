### The Idea

A 2D or 3D game inspired by the free-roam of Hitman and games where you play the detective. Investigate areas, talk to people, and find out the secrets behind your investigations. Cisila, obviously, is the main character. You'd be able to take advantage of her investigation abilities, Construct, and her agility. Scale buildings from the outside and climb inside, avoiding being spotted. Or head through the front door and get yourself into the crime scene legally. Optionally, everything can die instead. 

### Interactions, Items, etc.

During conversations, the screen will dim as the text box pop-ups appear, along with pixelated portraits. Expressions can change, from a smile to a frown, or anger to calmness. It depends on the conversation happening. Optimally, there'd be no dialogue choices to influence the story (this ain't no RPG) but there would be dialogue options to delve deeper into investigations, the world, and characters. Think "Tell me about yourself." for any Fallout companion, or for a more original example, "Can you explain [Piece of Evidence]?" during an investigation. Figuring out whether or not someone is lying can be done through interactions aswell, or through exploring. 

Items such as Cisila's Dual Revolvers or her Construct Blade would have unique item descriptions, along with any piece of evidence you might pick up. Other guns and weapons would have descriptions aswell, explaining their origins. It wouldn't be in depth at all, just a simple explanation of why it was made, perhaps.

Here's an example:

*Dual .44 Revolvers*

*I got these from Lakelight. They've been through hell and back, and probably need some cleaning.*

*.44 Ammo & Variations*

*Unsilenced, Heavy Hitter*


### Style, Abilities, and Cisila in-game

The game's artstyle could be a lot of things. Currently, I'm imagining prominently pixelated (maybe with 3d backgrounds and environments? Like that one game but I forgot its name.) modern-ish style when it comes to buildings and clothing, with purple being an important colour especially at nighttime (Since. You know. Cisila ourple.) while daytime has a more muted tone, still bright. For most of the story, however, it would be raining, and at night, due to the nature of the investigations. Daytime can be used as a travel opportunity to go between areas before an investigation (To Cisila's detective agency, to her apartment, stores, etc.) through the subway system. 

Cisila may have an upgrade tree relating to agility, Construct, and her investigation abilities. You'd be able to replay investigations after completing them (Hitman style) with new abilities to find more ways through it than previously. For example, you would not have Cisila's grapple gun mounted on her left arm as you begin. You wouldn't have the stamina to climb up a five story building. The upgrade tree wouldn't be too massive, but in addition to agility and Construct, Cisila's investigation abilities are able to grow as you progress. She might not be able to detect that someone's lying initially, but after a lot of experience through the game, you could go back through one of the first investigations and Cisila can detect that someone is lying, and add that to her mental notes. It would happen as part of the textbox, after someone is finished talking. 

Example:

Character:
*"[Anecdote, lying. Gives a tick that indicates something to Cisila.]."*

Cisila:
*(I saw him flinch. He's keeping his eyes away from me, aswell. Is he lying?)*

<- Suspicious Man added. Check the Board for details, and possible connections.

As opposed to this detail going unmissed, you may make a mistake in your investigation initially, having to find another way to discover the man is lying and may be hiding something. This could be your own intuition, though the dialogue may change depending on the level of Cisila's investigation abilities. Initially, neither Cisila or you can tell whether the man is lying. But when you re-do the investigation, the dialogue would include specific ticks in asterisks that indicate to you that something's off. Cisila picks up on these, and as explained previously, they are added to the board. You can question the man further and make him give it up, or sneak your way into his house to find the evidence he may be hiding.


### Setting

Chicago, obviously. An investigation kickstarts the campaign, leading Cisila through various areas and buildings in Chicago, ranging from apartments to the streets, company buildings to parks, and even the old PALMER-EDEN skyscraper, sitting there and rotting, unused. You wouldn't be told what PALMER-EDEN was directly, but you'd have to find pieces of lore scattered throughout the areas (including Cisila's office and apartment) and connect the dots to find out the original Cisila story, something that this wouldn't touch on at all, aside from throwaway lines and these lore tidbits. Heading to the skyscraper, you can uncover even more. You can find the area where Cisila was turned into an Ultima and learn what happened to her. However, the skyscraper would be locked until you complete the final investigation. It acts as a "final investigation" that's more quiet, mellow and oddly haunting. The building is empty, there are no enemies. Just Cisila and a flashlight, and the ominous shadows of the company skyscraper. Cisila remembers what happened gradually as you go deeper into the building.

*This is where they ruined me.* She might point out, on the test floor where the Ultima tubes lie. *This is where I killed him.* Near the top of the tower, on the helipad. It's also important to reference other events in the story subtly, with other dialogues from Cisila in other areas. Something may remind her of Kasey (who's likely in Japan during this) or Lyla (who would be a part of the game). Other areas would be accessible, but not part of the investigations initially. The lighthouse that Dani owned, one of the Brotherhood's hideouts, etc...

Most of the areas would be expansive, but in 2D. Apartments can be accessed through doors, or the outside of the building. Perhaps even the vent system is accessible from the roof of the building. Though, if the game is in a 3D environment, it's probably possible that you can go through every side of a building, investigating all of it - though that does seem like a bit much. In smaller environments like apartments (e.g. Cisila's) there'd be a lot of interactable objects, like Cisila complaining to herself that she needs to clean up her apartment, or her office. 

The lighting and general feel might be similar to *Deus Ex: Mankind Divided* with its really interesting lighting and neon signs, visible especially at night. 

### Story

Currently, I'm not sure what the story would be. Perhaps something similar to Mikhail - a serial killer loose, murdering people left and right, with Cisila chasing after them desperately. Maybe I can incorporate one of the original ideas for Mikhail: The victims' gravity is always flipped, leaving them dead on the ceiling, their blood pooling on the ceiling as if it were the floor. Maybe the first investigation isn't actually related to this, rather functioning as your introduction to the game. A simpler investigation, connected to a stolen wallet. This goes off the rails immediately after as Cisila is flooded with calls from people she knows, begging her to figure out the murder of someone in her own apartment complex.
