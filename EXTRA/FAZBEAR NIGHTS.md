It was almost midnight. The shadows of the tall trees around a prairie-styled house, which sat in a clearing. A dirt driveway went through the trees, and onto a hardly used road. The moon above was bright, the light from the sun reflecting off of it strongly. It was just between a full and half moon. The sky was clear, and everything was quiet, aside from the sounds of the forest and the wind. The lights in the simple house were on. The noise of a news anchor talking from a large, bulky CRT TV could be heard from one of the opened windows, but didn't travel far enough to be considered loud. In the house, a woman was cleaning dishes with a thick sponge, under a running faucet in the kitchen. Soap coated every dish as she cleaned, and cleaned. The dishes clinked and clanked as she moved them around and sorted them, stacking the plates upon each other and putting the forks and knives into piles. As she continued to wash the dishes, she listened to the news. On the CRT, the local news channel was displaying ongoing stories for any late-night viewers. The anchor rattled on and on about random local news, before suddenly turning to a more serious topic. The woman glanced at the TV as the anchor switched topics. "...In other news," The man began, "A pizzeria chain has suffered serious backlash this afternoon after one of their animatronic mascots..." He paused, looking down at his notes. He made a 'tch' noise, before continuing. "After one of their animatronic mascots caused serious damage to a child's frontal lobe." The anchor shuffled his notes and shook his head, "The child, aged seven, unfortunately passed only a few hours after. The parents of the child blame not just the company, but the employees who let their child get too close. This isn't the first time the company - and its subsidiaries - have faced legal trouble when it comes to injury." As the man continued on, the woman put down the dishes and turned the faucet off. She walked over to the TV and sat down in front of it on the floor, staring at the anchor as he continued to talk about the company. A thick plume of hair covered the right side of the woman's face. The back of her hair was down up into a poofy ponytail, with only some of the remaining untied hair finding its way around her neck. She looked like a mess. "When asked for comments, employees of Freddy Fazbear's declined, stating that the owners forbid them to talk." The man rattled on, sifting through his notes. "But when our on-site team went to Mr. William Afton's home, and asked for comment, we were met with the man himself." He lowered his head, looking down at the notes. "He told our team, quote, 'While I feel sympathy for the family, our animatronics aren't prone to major malfunctions such as this. This was entirely the child's fault, and I know that's hard to hear, but we've done extensive investigations.' end quote." The man looked back up at the camera, "Unfortunately, the co-founder, Mr. Henry Emily, was not available for comment. Even Mr. Afton was not aware of his location. Now, as most parents will be aware, Fazbear's is a very notorious location for incidents like these. For example, in 1983..." And then the man trailed off into a story she'd already heard before. One that had been drilled into her head. 

The death of a small child at the old Fredbear's Family Diner location. Afton's son. If anyone was going to take this seriously, it would've been Afton. But as she stared into the picture of Afton that had appeared on the screen as the news anchor talked about him, Cisila couldn't believe him. She had *watched* that child get forced over to the animatronic. It had bent over to greet the child, only for the kid's head to get lodged in between its jaws. The employees hadn't even tried to get her out before a horrible crunch echoed through the room, followed by the blood-curdling screech of a child. It was her sister. It was her sister's birthday. In an odd choice, Cisila's parents had decided to take the family to the local Freddy's location, despite Cisila's (and her sister's) reservations. Cisila disliked the company and its practices. She disliked the man in charge. This specific location they had gone to was the original, and was still where Afton worked. She frowned, remembering that she had seen the man just before her sister's untimely accident. Something was off with Afton, as she had recently realized. Despite being the face of the company, Afton never went out unless he had to. He was like a shadow. The company ignored his existence, aswell, unless legal troubles came up. Unless an animatronic malfunctioned. *Unless a child had gone missing...* She remembered. Friends of her sister had also had birthday parties here, and some of them never returned. In the midst of the bustling pizzeria, children continued to disappear. They continued to be injured, or even killed. Like her sister. Like that other kid- Afton's son. It was in 1983, only a few years ago. Frowning, she pushed that memory out of her head and turned to other matters. Her parents still weren't home, as they hadn't been able to cope with their second daughter passing. She was alone in their house, with only the TV to keep her company. It was already too dark outside to do anything, and she still didn't have a job. She'd have to take up the only offer she'd found...a simple cashier role at the local grocery store. It was a start. But as she continued to stare at the TV, which now displayed an image of the Freddy's location, she had an idea. It was probably stupid to think of it, but Cisila couldn't help. *What if I get a job at that location? What if I try to find out where all those children have gone?* In her spare time, and in school, Cisila had conducted multiple detective-like investigations. She was confident enough in her abilities that she thought that she could find something. *But...maybe not now. I need to get on my own two feet before I try and pull stunts like that.* \
It was far better to monitor the place before applying for a job, had the need ever come. The most optimal spot for investigating was a nightguard. Nobody else was in the building at night, and she'd have ample opportunities to have a look into the various backrooms and storage areas of the pizzeria that the employees, and Afton, used. She couldn't get her suspicion of Afton out of her head. He *had* something to do with this.

Standing up, Cisila yawned. It was already extremely late, and she had spent all of her energy today. The images of her sister flashed through her head for the tenth time. Cisila flinched, but walked to her room. In the back of her head, she got another idea. *It might be good to make a whole history of the company that I can follow. Those kids deserve some sort of closure...right? My sister, too.*

*Something's off with this whole thing.* She thought. *I think I can find that out, though, can't I?*

The phone rang at Henry's desk. The clunky phone vibrated as it rang, a monotonous beeping tone. Henry looked at it, halfway through pencilling a diagram. He looked tired. He was unshaved, and his glasses were sliding down his nose. His greying brown hair was messy, and short. Wrinkles were etched into his face. There was only one light on in the room, hanging above him. The rest of the room was cloaked in shadow. Awards and pictures on shelves in the room were barely visible. Several newspapers were stacked on Henry's desk, all of which related to Freddy Fazbear's. The phone continued to ring, and dejectedly, Henry answered it. Pulling it out of its dock with a thunk, he held it up. "Henry." A familiar voice said. Henry sighed, and responded, "Yes, William. What the *hell* happened today?" He asked. "Tch," William said, "Some kid got too close to Freddy. Don't know what did it." Henry put his pencil down slowly and leaned back in his chair, "What do you *mean* you don't know?" He pushed. "That was a major malfunction of the endoskeleton. How do those jaws snap shut like that? Her entire frontal lobe was just- *crushed.*" He hissed. "The only way those snap like that is due to liquid damage, or tampering." Henry seemed angry. William took a moment to respond, "Well, whatever the case..." He muttered, calmly. "It drew attention away from what's really happening, Henry." William lowered his voice more. Henry looked down at the desk, frowning. He knew that William had tampered with the Freddy animatronic. But there was nothing he could do to tell authorities of William's activities. "Y'know, it's amazing how one shock causes a community to forget about the disappearances." William continued, "Between this and the food poisoning incident, all eyes are averted." \
"What's your point, William?" Henry asked, rubbing his forehead. "What do you need to do next?" William chuckled, and seemed to sit down, judging by the sounds on the other end of the phone. "I'm not sure. Those kids, y'know..." He said, "They actually possessed the animatronics. It's stunning to see." *Stunning.* Henry thought. *Disgusting.* He sighed, "Right. You mangled those kids beyond recognition, and stuffed them into the suits. How many months did we get the oder complaint, again?" He said. "Five and a half." William responded, "It stopped just, uh, last week, actually." He chuckled again. "I'm sure they'll pick up again once I get that other kid into Foxy." Henry frowned, anxiety making its way through him. William talked about this as if it was completely normal. As if *he* was completely normal. There was nothing Henry could do to stop him. Tapping his foot against the floor, Henry sat up. "I still don't understand, William...what's the point in this? Killing *children?* Wouldn't adults..." Henry began, before pausing. There was no justification for killing anyone. But it seemed to be the only way to get through to William. "...Wouldn't adults cause less problems? A lot more adults go missing per year, William." He leaned forward on his desk, putting his weight onto his elbow. "Only children have the imagination and the soul for this to function." William responded. "Freddy Fazbear's is where fantasy and fun come to life, after all. Come to *life.*" He laughed. "It's incredible to watch the animatronics twitch and suffer." *You mean the children.* Henry thought, shutting his eyes. "After midnight, the kids take over. They attack anyone and everything, all mental capacity just...gone." William continued. "They think any moving thing is *me.* They hate me." Henry remembered the incident with the dog. A wild dog had gotten into the pizzeria after midnight, and when the first employees entered, they saw its mangled corpse just in front of the main stage. The location had to remain closed for that day. Henry was certain the bloodstains were still there, if faint. He couldn't imagine such a thing happening to an actual *human.* The nightguard seemed to have no problems, but he had a feeling that that wasn't going to last. 

"What I need you to do, Henry, is see if you can erase any and all evidence pointing to me." William suddenly said, snapping Henry out of his thoughts. "The police can't find out about this for obvious reasons, you know...and if I do get caught, you understand what happens to you." His tone turned from the joyful insanity, to resentment. Henry nodded slowly, looking around the room. In each corner, there were tiny devices resembling hockey pucks, with a singular red light blinking. "...I know, William." Henry said. "I just...need the documents sent to me. Seeing as I can't leave this...this room." He stuttered. "Of course!" William responded, "Anything for you, dear old friend." He laughed. "But, in the meantime...I expect you to finish those design documents." \
Henry nodded again, "Yes." He mumbled. "Keep...keep doing that you're doing, William." He sighed, dejectedly. William hung up and Henry put the phone back into its dock, and he looked back down at the binder. He was only halfway done the design for an animatronic. *Funtime Freddy*, he'd called it. The *Funtime* line was something William had forced him to work on, and he was stuck in this office because of it. Looking up from his desk slowly, he saw the giant silhouette of an animatronic standing at the door. It looked shoddily built, put together with simple plastic pieces, and creaked with every subtle movement. It was shaped like Freddy, but was all wrong. Its eyes were locked onto Henry, unblinking. Unfeeling. It kept him in the office. And it would kill him if he tried to leave. It was one of William's shoddy creations, a functionally obsolete model turned into a horror show. Henry stared at it, resentment bubbling up inside him. He had turned one of Henry's own creations into something that could kill him at a moment's notice. And not only that, it could...do other things. Sometimes, its form would change. Henry looked back up at the blinking hockey pucks. *I can hear them beep, sometimes. What are they?*

In the back of his head, Henry had a plan to get out. But it might take years to execute. It might not even be worth it. But somehow, William had to be stopped. Henry was the only one who knew his true intentions. He would get out.

But, of course, he had to start somewhere. And once he got those documents, Henry knew just what to do.
