# The *Platinum Halberd*
The CSEP *Platinum Halberd* has four decks:

-A deck
-B deck
-C deck
and D deck

Each deck serves a different purpose.

D Deck: Primarily the maintenance level where engineers work on the ship's engines, power levels, and efficiency. Repairs and the repair bay are also down here.

C Deck: Primary level for crew quarters, but there are some smaller laboratories on this deck. Facilities also include the cafeteria, library and datalogs, aswell as leisure areas.

B deck: Primary level for laboratories and experiments, aswell as operating firing ranges and weapon test areas. This is where the work gets done.

A deck: Hub for security, engineer coordination, and the bridge. This is where higher level personnel work and live. There are quarters up here disconnected from the rest for the main cabin crew, aswell as higher rank security officers.

## Details

Each deck stretches the length of the ship, using all the space possible. The ship itself is a sleek design, using the most up-to-date technologies, having been launched in 2095, along with its sister ship, the *Iron Pike*. Its primary objective is furthering weapons development, biological tech, armor testing, and many other things for its owner, Carbine. "CSEP" at the beginning of its name refers to *Carbine Standard Experimental Platform*, showing that the *Halberd* is one of the first of its kind. Its engines are large, efficient, but can be quite unstable at times. Its power cells, the main source of energy on the ship, require constant maintenance. Basically, the entire ship on the inside is a mess that is barely being held together by the commendable teamwork and coordination of the engineer crew, while the outside acts as a poster child for Carbine's technological advancements. The A deck crew was hand picked to live as best they could, while the engineer, laboratory, and various other crew were picked via a unique testing process determining their skillset. Cisila J. Siveta, 26 in this alternate world, became an engineer and found her way onto the *Halberd* after passing the testing process with flying colours. However, the *Halberd* wasn't as glamorous as she first assumed it to be. 

## Stock, Gear, and Capabilities

The CSEP *Platinum Halberd* is fitted with state of the art technology that allows it to stay in space for extended amounts of time. Its projected life extends to a decade, but constant refueling and supplies are brought on, negating the need (not that anyone would actually be alive after a decade due to food still being limited). It has excellent scanning systems and defenses, with large Carbine turrets installed in various key areas on the ship to deter any kind of trouble, aswell as the ability to shoot down asteroids before they hit. Its cockpit is reminiscent of a *Hammerhead Corvette* from Star Wars, but turned horizontal instead of vertical. It doesn't have the ramming power of one of these corvettes, however. It is purely a research frigate. 

Its repair bays are fitted with modern technology, including brand new plasma welders, up-to-date welding torches for smaller jobs, and various wrenches, screwdrivers, jackerhammers- basically everything one might need for a repair. It's also equipped with two dozen suits of Hammerhead Heavy-Duty Exoskeleton And Titan Heart [HDEATH] suits to allow for in-space repairs, on the exterior of the ship- aswell as any other external use.
