#### CODENAME GRADIENT

*"Three...two...one."* The automated AI counted down slowly, and Gradient felt the sudden *thunk* of the tiny metal pod she was in hit the ground. It was riding along a rail that went deep into the Earth, and it had finally reached the bottom. *"Destination reached. Approximately three thousand metres underground, heat levels high. Suggested equipment settings: High-Powered, Heavy Armor, Heat Resistant. Detected anomalies within this sector of PALMER-EDEN Underground: Just under four thousand anomalies. Most are Xeno D-Class, and do not pose a threat. Most vicious anomalies are Xeno A-Class, but are located much further down. Have a pleasant day."* As soon as it finished its spiel, Gradient grabbed onto a set of levers in the pod, yanking them down. A hissing noise from the hydraulics of the front door filled her ears. As she pulled down the levers, a large, bulky helmet lowered itself over her head. It *clicked,* and sealed around her head cleanly. It connected to the rest of her armor, which used to be for PALMER-EDEN engineers just a few years ago. It was heavy-duty, suited for conditions like this, and *really fucking uncomfortable.* As she let go of the levers and flipped a few other switches in the pod, the hydraulic door started to open. Pulling her feet out of the footholds in the pod, she started to pull herself free of the pod. The heat was already leaking in as the door began to open. It was like a scorching blaze, even with the heat resistant engineer gear. The suit even had A/C, but it didn't seem to help. She wasn't even sure if it was on, as she had no idea how to use this suit at all. Climbing out of the pod, Gradient stepped out onto a metal platform - where all pods landed. There were a few already on the level, *J-LEVEL,* she remembered. And they were all open. Empty, though. A bad sign. Grabbing onto the holstered weapon on her right hip, she used her left hand to push down a couple buttons on the side of her helmet. One was a camera, which began to record from her point-of-view, and the other was the power switch for the suit's communication devices. "Checking in." She said, hearing the comms whirr to life. "Codename Gradient on J-LEVEL, floor six." Quietly, she waited for a response. It wasn't smart to keep moving deeper if, at this depth, she already couldn't get an answer. But, she got an answer. "Ground Team reads you, Gradient." A voice said. *Kellien's.* Her mind echoed. Kellien was nice, and probably the only one who actually cared about her. But that was neither here nor there at the moment. She turned to look at the empty pods, "Rest of Alpha Team seems to have already disembarked," She observed. "No signs of a struggle - must've been a clean entrance. May have gone missing deeper in. Repeat - may have gone missing deeper in." Gradient only repeated these words because she knew Kellien would miss these details. 

"Copy that," Kellien muttered. "Move deeper in. Palmer says you're clear to use lethal force." 

Gradient took a few steps forward, unholstering the large, bulky handgun and racking the slide. With her other hand, she yanked a strange contraption off of her utility belt and attached it to the front of the handgun. It whirred, and snapped onto the front tightly. As soon as it secured itself, it sprang open and seemed to spin around, trying to find the right way to go. Watching it patiently, Gradient saw it finally settle. It wasn't quite a suppressor, but it looked like one. What it *would* do, however, was feed energy into the bullets and make them more powerful. It would obliterate any D-Class that got close enough. *Alright, that'll do for now.* She thought. Looking up, she scanned the level with her eyes. The PALMER-EDEN Underground was supposed to have been a project that would save most of humanity. *Supposedly.* An underground city. Power for millenia. Self-sustainability, and no reason to go up to the surface. But it had failed. It had failed because of one strange thing the construction teams had discovered. Some kind of strange colony of creatures deep underground. At the point they'd been discovered, the project had almost been finished. From A-LEVEL to M-LEVEL, people were already living in the underground city. But then this colony of *things,* not quite bugs, but not aliens either, took over. They must have killed millions by this point. Anybody still living inside the underground city had to be above J-LEVEL because of the heat. The heat had come from the Xenos (what PALMER-EDEN called them) breaking most of the systems maintaining control over temperatures, humidity, and general quality of life. Anybody on the level when those systems broke had probably burned to death. Only specialized armor, like the engineer gear she had on, could survive. And even then, it was only for five hours. She began to walk down the platform and stairs, heading towards the main entrance for J-LEVEL. Streaks of burnt blood lined the walkway she crossed, which went over a small ravine that glowed with lava. Heading towards the entrance, she looked up. It was a large building that looked as though it was slowly melting away. Metal panels were peeling off the side of the building, and the large "ENTRANCE" text was melting aswell. It was rather unsettling. Even windows looked like they were melting - glass slowly dripping down the sides of the building. 

Inhaling, she promptly entered the building. Pushing open the doors, which seemed to protest by scraping loudly along the metal floor, she stepped into the lobby. It was slightly nicer than the industrial look that was outside, but because of the Xenos and the heat, it was still incredibly horrid. Blood, once more, coated the floors and walls. Burnt corpses, frozen in time, littered the lobby. There was a front desk, which looked as though it had almost melted completely. Burn marks covered most of it, but Gradient could just make out the words "CHECK-IN DESK" on the front. About fifty thousand people lived on this level, for about two weeks. And she was standing in the place where most of them died. If there weren't corpses here, they had completely burned to a crisp and disappeared into nothingness. None of the people on this level had survived. It was a ghost city - other than the Xeno D-Class bug-things that had settled in. And here she was, walking in like nothing had happened. Well, something *had* happened, and that was why she was down here. Alpha Team, one of PALMER-EDEN's exterminator teams, working on clearing the levels of any Xenos, had gone missing down here. Gradient had been sent down here to find them, and she was going to do exactly that. She walked past the welcome desk as quietly as she could, heading for the set of doors behind it. She went to grab the handle and push the doors open, but they wouldn't budge. Gradient tried to push harder, and harder. But it seemed like the doors were locked, somehow. When she peered through the glass on the doors, she saw a crowbar shoved through the handles on the other side. It wasn't some rusted, old crowbar, however. It was a brand new one. A sign that Alpha Team had been through here. Had they blocked the door for some reason? Gradient couldn't tell, and instead of trying to get the door open with her hands, she stepped back. Holstering her handgun for a brief moment, she reached down for her utility belt and flicked a switch on it. The lower half of the engineer suit seemed to whirr to life - Hinges around her knees sputtered to life and seemed to strengthen her legs. *Alright, door.* She cracked her neck from side to side before preparing to sprint straight at the door. Gradient planted her feet flat against the floor, and suddenly, lunged at the door with incredibly speed and immense force. She leaned forward so her shoulder hit the door, and on the other side, the crowbar snapped in two because of the amount of energy she'd put into the doors - with the help of the suit. On the other side of the doors, she walked down the hallway, heading for the main atrium of the underground city. Turning on her comms once more, she announced, "Got through the lobby. No signs of Alpha Team. Heading for the atrium next." As she pushed open the next set of doors and stepped out into the large atrium, she got a response, "Copy. You've still got five hours to look." Kellien said. Gradient pulled out the handgun once more as she looked around the atrium. A large, open space where you could see the cave's ceiling above you. It was almost like a mall - just far more industrial and purely for living. Down here, there was no such thing as "brand name clothes". It didn't matter, it *hadn't* mattered in years. Not since America and the rest of the world had traded nuclear bombs. Most cities had been burned to the ground. 

Everything had shattered. And then, like a glimmer of hope, PALMER-EDEN appeared from nowhere. Formerly a pharmaceutical company dabbling in strange things, they showed the world that they had a solution. On every news broadcast still going, the CEO showed every detail of his idea, his *dream* to save the world. It hadn't even taken a month before it all went to shit, once he'd gotten everyone into the underground city. And now he was responsible for the deaths of millions, after the world had already had enough death. And now she, Gradient, was stuck down here. Looking for some *dipshits* who couldn't do their job correctly. Ever since the Underground closed and went into "maintenance", there were extermination teams working around the clock to constantly clear out every level of the Underground. It never worked. Gradient knew that the endeavor was pointless - but she couldn't stop Palmer. It felt like she owed a debt to him, after he saved her from imminent death. *Whatever that death might've been...* She thought. She couldn't remember. Gradient assumed it had something to do with the bombs dropping. She'd lost her arms; Palmer had replaced them. She'd almost lost her life; Palmer saved her. The least she could do was work, but to her, she expected something less...menial. For whatever reason, Gradient assumed she would've gotten more special assignments. Instead, she'd gotten stuck with rescuing the extermination teams by herself. Solo. It was a suicide mission. As she walked through the atrium slowly, Gradient couldn't help but feel like she someone was watching her. *Something.* She corrected herself. Slowing down, Gradient suddenly heard a noise. Strange clicking, and...*chatter.* It was Xenos. That meant one thing: Alpha Team hadn't gotten very far. Extermination team protocols dictated that they should clean out the entrance first and foremost. They had *not* done that, and that meant...

Her thoughts were suddenly caught off as she heard a gross crunch under her feet. Her brow furrowed. She used her free hand to turn on her helmet's night vision, and she looked down. She had stepped on one of the Alpha Team squad members' hand. It had broken completely, and the blood that splattered out from it was already boiling. Their armor was torn to shreds, and their body was already burning. It looked as though they had been mauled. Slowly, she looked up at the higher levels of the atrium. Another one of Alpha Team was hanging from a chain, strung up like a piece of meat on a meat hook. Their organs were torn out of their body, and she could see their ribcage. Slowly, Gradient turned on her comms again. "Alpha Team is down. Repeat: Alpha Team is *down.*" She said, simply. "I'm commencing extraction. They're gone." Without waiting for a response, Gradient turned around swiftly and tried to head back towards the lobby. She was stopped in her tracks as soon as a D-Class Xeno landed in front of her with an unearthly buzz. It clicked and chattered, staring at her. It was a mess of legs, and mandibles. She couldn't tell what type it *exactly* was (D-class was its danger level) but it didn't matter. She spotted what looked like the face of a man stretched out of the bugs' abdomen. He was already dead - but his face was screaming for help. Without waiting for it to lunge at her, Gradient swung the handgun up, gripped it with both of her hands, and pulled the trigger. Not just once. Twice. And then three times. Each individual shot filled the atrium with a loud *BANG.* Every round fired lit the place up like fireworks, and the bullets pierced the bug cleanly, lodging themselves in its body before detonating. It was violent, but it was the only way to deal with the things. Reeling herself away from the bug, she continued to pop shots off in its direction. It clicked its mandibles and emitted some kind of screech as it got injured, and tried to scuttle its way towards Gradient. Dumping the empty magazine of her handgun, she quickly shoved in a new one and racked the slide. But it had gotten too close. Instead of trying to shoot it, she quickly holstered the handgun and firmly grabbed onto two of its mandibles, trying to keep it away from herself. She desperately pushed it down to the ground, using the strength the suit gave her to overwhelm the D-Class. Gradient punched it into the floor and it seemed to have gotten dazed by her punch. Standing up, she decided to use the moment she'd gotten.

She raised her foot, and stomped down on the bugs' head. It exploded in a blast of bug juice, and human remains.

Gradient kicked the bugs' corpse away and retreated back to the lobby, sprinting as fast as she could in the engineer's gear. It wasn't very fast at all - it was more like a light jog. And that annoyed her greatly, as she continued to retreat, heading back across the walkway and up to the pod platform. Turning on the comms once more, she reported, "Got a D-Class. I'm leaving, whether Palmer wants it or not. There's no reason to stay." She quickly climbed back into the pod, took hold of both of the levers on each side of her, and pushed them upwards. The pod's door slammed shut in front of her, and a mechanical arm gently pulled the bulky helmet off of her head. Underneath, she was sweating. A lot. The amount of hair Gradient had didn't help, either. It was a mess, and greasy. She hadn't been able to shower in a couple of days because of the amount of work she'd been through. But now, Gradient was hoping for a break. There was no Alpha Team to find. Not anymore. The pod's lights flicked on, enveloping Gradient in a shockingly blue light. It was the opposite of the strange orange glow that enveloped most of J-LEVEL. Gradient breathed a sigh of relief, feeling her entire body relax. The pod jostled suddenly, before lifting away from J-LEVEL. She was going back up to the surface. Back to safety.

#### CODENAME GRADIENT

*I've only been awake for a few months. Martin Palmer unsealed my cryo pod, and told me he had work for me. I didn't remember who he was. I didn't even know who I was. He seemed confused by that...he asked me my name. I said I didn't remember. Then, he asked if I knew who he was. I said no. He looked at me, and I saw something in his eyes. Triumph? I could never be sure. He told me, "Not to worry." and helped me out of the pod. He was nice. I had vague memories of other people, but they were all negative. He was the only shining light in my foggy memory. The only one who helped...* She was thinking to herself again. The scene repeated in her head over and over. Gradient was standing at the window of her quarters, watching the city below. The PALMER-EDEN Elite Skyscraper housed all of its branches, including Security & Military, where Gradient was stationed. Her quarters, for whatever reason, were far, far up the skyscraper, and she had them to herself, unlike Kellien, who had to sleep with his squad. Martin saw something in her, she guessed, and that was why she was so high up. And up here, Gradient could see the crumbling city below. A bit of research had led her to learn that the PALMER-EDEN Elite Skyscraper was situated in the middle of an old U.S city called Chicago. Thirty odd years ago, the U.S engaged in a massive civil war, destroying almost all of the country. Every major city had fallen, the government had disappeared. And now all that was left were the companies fighting to survive. Most of them, at least. PALMER-EDEN rose above the rest, crushed its opposition, and cemented itself as the new government. For practical purposes. Gradient stared down at the deserted roads, the crumbling buildings...and only saw devastation. *Martin told me there was no way I could live normally, not without PALMER-EDEN. He said I didn't need to have a name...* She raised one of her hands to the glass, and let it rest against it. Her cybernetic hands looked complicated, and the cybernetics continued up her arms and stopped around her elbows. Her legs were partially cybernetic aswell, from the knees below. A large prosthetic was shoved into her right eye, effectively replacing it. Gradient had never asked why that had to happen, because it was the only one she'd had surgery for *after* waking up, as she'd woken up with the arms and the legs. It was painful. She could almost feel the pain flow through her face when she remembered the surgery. 

*It was after that. A day after, I was standing here just like I am now. He walked into my room. I looked at him, and he asked, again, what my name was. Maybe he was curious about something. I told him...I didn't have a name. I said I didn't need one. And he nodded, smiling.* She exhaled. Gradient was just a codename. In reality, she had no name. There wasn't a point, she thought. She knew nobody. It was all work. Wake up, work, go to sleep. *Wake up, work, go to sleep.* It was engraved in her mind. A neverending cycle of sleep, murder, and sweat. She stretched, and turned away from the window. She was wearing a tank top and a pair of black cargo pants. Half of her "above ground" ensemble. The rest was down in the equipment room, along with her weapons. Large boots resistant to the outside, a bulky and high tech military vest, and a backpack that attached to the vest. Pulling her phone off the table, Gradient checked it. It was where, if he couldn't get to her at the moment, Martin would contact her. And there *was* a message. Opening it, Gradient scanned it quickly. *Today, I'd like you to head outside. Kellien will give you some pointers. - M.* She put her phone down and immediately left her quarters. There was a thing to do today, and she had *nothing* else to do. Walking out of her quarters into the sterile white hallway that connected the other private quarters, Gradient walked towards the elevator at the end of the hallway. Pressing the button for it to open, she waited. After a few seconds of waiting, the doors opened with a soft clunk. Gradient stepped inside, and scanned the elevator buttons for the floor she needed to go to. *Floor...five.* She remembered, pressing the button. It glowed, acknowledging her request, and the elevator shunted downwards. *Floor five. Equipment & Preparation. One of the lowest levels of the Skyscrapers...* The Skyscraper was divided into five sections, for each PALMER-EDEN branch. The highest, just above where Gradient was, was the Medical Division. Below that was Cybernetic development. Where her cybernetic arms and legs were developed. The last two Divisions were split into Equipment & Preparation, where PALMER-EDEN developed tech for its security teams, and Gradient's level, the Military Division, was the final one, and the lowest. It was there to defend the entrances. 

The elevator came to a stop and its doors opened. Stepping out, Gradient looked around herself, at the large floor. The Equipment & Preparation Division was split into several levels, of course, but this one was packed with equipment racks and engineers working on larger modules such as turrets, and deployable command centers. She sidled her way through the many metal tables with firearms and blades on them, making her way towards the other end of the floor, where Alpha Team's gear was kept - in addition to her own. Pushing open the heavy metal door that led to the equipment room for Alpha Team, Gradient stepped in. It was a room filled with equipment. Weapon racks held dozens of in-house made PALMER-EDEN firearms, and blades hung from other racks. Gear like vests were neatly sorted into piles, and everything else was neatly tucked away into footlockers. The room itself had harsh white lights shining down on most of the tables, and the floor was a smooth white. The walls were soundproofed. Walking over to her footlocker, she flipped it open. Her gear was neatly tucked into it. She pulled out her combat boots and swapped out her normal shoes for them. She pulled out her custom made vest, and pulled it on, clicking it together. Checking the pockets on the vest, she began to shove pistol magazines into the pouches, aswell as energy cells. Pulling her pistol out from the footlocker, Gradient pulled the slide back to check if it was loaded. It wasn't, so she loaded it, slid it into its holster under her left arm, which was attached to the vest. Her upper arms were bare, and her cybernetics were on full display in the harsh equipment room light. Sleek black metal interwoven with carbon fibres, all the way up to her fingertips. Small panels with orange colors, indicating the prototype status of the cybernetic parts. Gradient flexed her cybernetic fingers, feeling some kind of...pain inside them. It wasn't really there. It never was. But it kept returning. She flicked her wrist, trying to get rid of the pain. *Won't go...* She thought. Instead, she sighed, and returned to retrieving her gear. Pulling out a sheathed blade, she attached it to her belt. It was a mostly metal blade, machined to a perfect sharpness. Its weight was perfectly balanced, making swings easy. It was PALMER-EDEN's finest blade. Finally, she attached her backpack to her vest. It wasn't massive, but it held the essentials.

Rolling her shoulders back and making sure she had no muscle problems, Gradient turned around, only to see Kellien enter the equipment room. "...Oh." Gradient muttered. "Good morning." She said, quietly. "Hey." Kellien said, walking over to his own footlocker. He was a rough looking man, in his thirties. He was around before the destruction of the U.S, but that didn't mean much. "So, uh..." He started to say, sifting through his footlocker, and getting his gear ready. "Palmer wants you to scout out this one building, east of here. Some of our satellites picked up a *lot* of movement out there." He pulled a pair of gloves on, and Gradient crossed her arms. "Why me?" She asked. Kellien shrugged. "Just get out there, Gradient." He said, sighing. "Your motorbike's ready down in the garages, and it's already loaded with the coords." He continued. Gradient nodded, "Y'sir." she said, heading back towards the door. Leaving the equipment room, she headed down a set of stairs, going all the way down to the garages on the very first floor of the skyscraper. It was a big of a trek, but on mornings like this, she preferred to walk down instead of taking the elevator. Entering the garages, Gradient looked around at all the vehicles sitting dormant. Most weren't able to be used - old pickup trucks and sedans used as salvage for newer models. However, in one of the bays, sat Gradient's personal Hammerhead DC-01X, a motorcycle that she didn't quite know the origin of. It was one of the best motorcycles still in production, able to tackle the climate of the U.S Remnants with little to no trouble. It was sleek, curved like a running leopard. The garage bay's door was closed, but even then, a few of the windows were letting light spill in. The light was harsh. Slowly, Gradient climbed onto the motorcycle, and grabbed onto the handles. Flicking a few switches on, the motorcycle flared to life with a quiet whirr, which got higher and higher in tone until it faded away, out of human hearing range. The instruments flickered on as the motorcycle quivered in anticipation. Gradient pressed down on a button on the motorcycle's HUD, and the garage bay door. As the door slowly opened, squeaking and creaking, Gradient reached behind her and yanked a respirator mask off of her back pack, pulling it over her face. *First time outside in days.* She thought. *Three.* She tapped her foot against the motorcycle's pedal as she counted. *Two.* The garage door had almost opened completely. The harsh light now enveloped most of the bay. *One.* And with a loud clunk, the garage door stopped moving. Holding tight onto the handlebars, Gradient let the motorcycle do its thing. In one swift motion, the motorcycle whirred once more and shot off into the daylight. Into the Remnants.

The sun's heat hit hard as soon as the motorcycle hit the crackling pavement that surrounded the PALMER-EDEN Skyscraper, and as it continued further, slight bumps caused the bike to jump a little. Gradient leaned down further, pressing herself against the bike so as not to be flung off suddenly. The crumbling buildings flew by, as did the small dunes of sand that had formed over the past thirty years. Some streets were completely blocked off by sand, and others were still open - but occupied by strange people...cannibals, thieves, and even the undead. But most of them tried to stay inside. As the motorcycle weaved in and around the streets, avoiding the various wreckages of old vehicles, Gradient looked down at the instruments. The route, she noticed, was straight towards the second tallest tower in the city. Recalling the history she'd read up on, the building used to be called the Pierce Building. She didn't know what it was used for, but it was notable enough to have old pictures sitting around in PALMER-EDEN's database. As she weaved around a large semi truck half buried in sand, she noticed a group on the road. Digging her heels into the pedals, she forced the motorcycle to slide to a stop. It skidded along the crumbling paved road before coming to a complete halt. The group had set up some kind of checkpoint, made out of scrap metal and wood. *Great.* She thought, climbing off her motorcycle. Taking hold of her sheathed blade, she walked slowly towards the group. "'Ey." One of them spat. "No passin' through unless you've got your payment." Payment? What were these people on? Money had become pointless. "The hell's a payment supposed to be for?" Gradient asked, pulling off her respirator, and shoving it back into her bag, "Are you aware of how useless currency is these days?" One of them scoffed at her, and replied, "Ain't currency." Gradient cocked her head at them, "Then what the hell do you want?" she asked, beginning to get suspicious. One of them walked forward, and Gradient immediately came to a halt. "Hands on you." They said. *The fuck?* She thought. They didn't look *that* crazy, but as the man lunged at her, Gradient instinctively unsheathed her blade and sliced his arms off in one clean motion. Bewildered, the man stumbled back. His arms hit the ground, splattering blood everywhere. The rest of the strange group suddenly jumped into action, lunging at Gradient. 

<sup><sub>Note: Cue We've Got Hostiles from morch kovalski's "Unforeseen Consequences"</sub></sup>

The first one to get close enough to her pulled out some kind of knife, but wasn't fast enough to stab her. Instead, Gradient ducked under their attempted stab and slashed their shins, before lunging upwards and forcing her blade through the bottom of the attacker's chin. It went straight through their skull, ripped their brain apart, and killed them instantly. Gradient let go of her blade and let the attacker fall to the ground, and instead of retrieving her blade for now, she pulled out her pistol and shot down the rest of the attackers. The bullets exploded upon impact, doing more damage than an antique pistol ever could. The group fell to the floor, but they weren't quite dead. Ripping her blade out of the man's skull, she walked towards the ones still alive, who were now bleeding on the ground. Gradient looked down at who she thought was the leader of the group, and watched him struggle. He seemed to suddenly pull out something, and press a button on it. It looked like some kind of makeshift device. "Not...the end." He gasped. "You don't...mess with us, we-" But she'd had it. They were already getting in the way of her task, but they'd also gotten far too close to the PALMER-EDEN building. Other people would also get stopped by them if she didn't do anything. Gradient shot the man in the head before he could finish speaking. And then she turned her pistol on the other people in the group, shooting each until she was sure they were dead. She sighed, before sheathing her blade. But something didn't feel right. *What was that thing?* She thought, grabbing the device out of the leader's hand. It was an old cellphone with a large mechanical button attached to the back, wired to the phone itself. A small makeshift antenna was attached aswell. *Some kind of signal?* Gradient wondered, looking up. And then she heard something. More footsteps. The barricade the raiders had made suddenly broke open, and a dozen more of them leaped through. "Oh, fuck-" She spat, reloading her pistol. Backing up fast, she started wildly firing her pistol. Most of the shots missed, and, due to her panic, the ones that *did* connect barely did anything. The raiders pulled out their own firearms, and Gradient realized what a mistake she'd made. She'd pissed off a bunch of them at once. She could handle a small group, but not a swarm like this. As she holstered her pistol and tried to sprint towards her motorcycle, it suddenly became harder and harder to sprint.

Her legs pushed harder, and harder, yet she was only slowing down. It began to feel like she was pushing through a thick gel, unable to move. Something was happening. Forcing her head back, her eye went wide. The raiders were moving slowly too. Their movements looked floaty, as if...they were in slow motion. Gradient pushed even harder, but found herself unable to move. Completely. Time had stopped. A blue haze began to settle in, coating everything. She was frozen. *Frozen.* Unable to move her head now, all she could do was stare at the frozen raiders. *What is causing this? What the fuck is happening?* Her mind screamed. And then, as if trying to answer her question, a shadow enveloped the sun above them. It wasn't the moon. It was something else. Everything was plunged into darkness. And she couldn't move an inch. She heard footsteps, suddenly. Echoing footsteps were the only thing she could hear. A bright blue glow suddenly appeared in her vision, taking the form of a person. It seemed to pull out some kind of blade, like Gradient's, and twirled it around. In a sudden flash of light, the mysterious figure killed the dozen raiders trying to get to Gradient. *What...the fuck?* Gradient thought, staring in shock. As the raiders were blasted apart at their abdomens, frozen in time, the glowing figure turned towards Gradient. That was when she noticed something...the haze that was enveloping the street was mesh. The figure was polygonal, blocky. Yet you could still tell it was a human. *What...is happening?* She tried to think at the figure. It walked closer.

*"You can't die."* It echoed. And it repeated. *"You can't die. You can't die."* There was no mouth for it to speak from, and its voice seemed to be in her own head. The voice was feminine. *Why?* She thought at it. *Tell me, why can't I die?* It turned away from her, flexing its blocky fingers. *"Else it'll have all been for nothing."* It echoed. *What are you? Who are you?* Her mind screamed. But it didn't respond. It faded away. As did the mesh covering everything. Instead of easing Gradient out of the time freeze, everything suddenly started moving again. She slammed face first into the paved road, unable to keep her balance. She realized she hadn't been able to breathe the whole time, and her body was trying to compensate by hyperventilating. Gradient coughed, trying to pull herself up. But she couldn't. Her arms *really* hurt. Her hands were in immense pain...why? *Why?* She thought. *Why do they hurt? They shouldn't hurt...I can't...feel them.* Feeling a sudden burst of exhaustion, she felt herself quivering. Gradient felt sick. Whatever just happened to her, it made her feel like complete *shit.* "Gradient! Gradient?!" Her radio suddenly crackled to life. "Gradient, are you alright?" It was Kellien. Twisting a knob on the radio attached to her vest, she coughed again, before weakly responding, "...Yes. Yes, I'm alive. I'm fine." She was *not* fine, but she didn't have the energy to explain to Kellien what just happened. "You *completely* disappeared from our SATNAV, you know that, right? Palmer got scared shitless when that happened." He said, nervously. "Seriously. What the *hell* happened?" Gradient finally pulled herself up and collapsed next to her motorcycle, leaning against it. "I don't *fucking* know." She muttered. "I just...need...a second." It was a struggle to even speak. Whatever had just happened had not only made her feel sick, but it had sapped her of all her energy. She let her head rest against the motorcycle. "Gradient, seriously...I can't just..." Kellien was sputtering, but Gradient couldn't muster the energy to respond. "Just-" Gradient tried to say, "...just let me...do my job. *Please.*" Her speech was slurring. "Jesus, Gradient-" Kellien said, "Stay put. We're coming to get you. You don't sound fine at all."

No, no, *no.* Gradient pulled herself up, using the motorcycle was support. "No you fucking do *not...*" She sputtered, but she got no response. Sweating profusely, she felt even worse than she already did. But she didn't *need* help. She didn't want to waste Kellien's time, but it was already too late...and then she looked up. The sun was gone. The moon was high in the sky.

That thing hadn't just frozen time. It had shunted her forwards. She slid down the side of the motorcycle again, and coughed up blood. *Shit...*

"I told you, I'm *fine.*" Gradient tried to say for the tenth time, but Kellien wouldn't hear it. He had already checked her blood pressure, her muscles, and everything else he thought might be the problem. "Jesus..." He muttered, "It's like something just- sapped you of energy." He held up a camera, scanning Gradient's body with it. "It's saying that you haven't eaten in a week. But I literally saw you eating dinner yesterday...what is going on?" He sounded just as confused as Gradient felt. They were still sitting on the street. The rest of Kellien's squad, Alpha Team, were securing the perimeter and tearing down the checkpoint the raiders had made. The darkness of the night was pressing down on everybody. The stars were bright, though some were obscured by the dark husks of buildings. The only lights down on the surface were those that Alpha Team had put up. "Okay, well...if I just..." Kellien muttered, pulling open his backpack. He pulled out some kind of syringe and carefully injected Gradient in the arm. "That'll help you feel...uh...*not* hungry for now. But you need to eat something, ASAP." Gradient shook her head, "S'fine. I'll live." she muttered. At the very least, she was beginning to feel better. When Kellien and Alpha Team had arrived, she felt as though she was on the verge of vomiting. Now, it had subsided. She'd stopped shaking. Inhaling deeply, she felt her lip quiver. "Alright," Kellien sighed, "I guess you're able again." He picked up his backpack, and pulled it over his shoulders. "Palmer's pissed, it seems. He might know what happened. But," He said, "He says your mission's still more important. Scout that place out, then immediately return. His words." Gradient nodded, pulling herself up and climbing onto her motorcycle. She felt rejuvenated by the syringe. "*Why* am I scouting the place out, though? Any specifics?" She asked. Kellien shook his head, "Nada. Palmer just wants someone to look there, says he thinks something's going on there. So just...take notes of everything." He said. "Alright," Gradient mumbled, turning the motorcycle back on with a soft whirr. She drove off, weaving through the checkpoint being taken apart. Getting through it, she turned the motorcycle's headlights on. Extremely powerful beams illuminated the road ahead, and Gradient could now get to the Pierce Building with ease. Assuming...that *thing* didn't show up again.

Pulling up to the entrance of the rubble covered Pierce Building, Gradient shut off the bike's lights. She climbed off of it and pulled a pair of bulky night vision goggles out of her backpack, before pulling them over her face. It tightly sealed to her face, and as she turned them on, they gave a sharp, loud, *whirr.* The surroundings flared to life, in a sharp black-grey-white scale. The stars above her were amplified in the night vision, looking more like lamps in the sky. The moon above her was even brighter, and she could clearly see the craters littering the surface. By chance, she also saw...a light on the moon. A blinking light. *Moonbase Beta.* She remembered. The second attempt PALMER-EDEN had created at making an ecosystem on the moon...she had no idea how it was going, but that blinking light surely meant they were still alive. Unlike most people down on Earth's surface. Gradient looked back down at the entrance to the Pierce Building. It was mostly covered in rubble, its windows shattered. But she was able to spot a way through the rubble, assuming she was willing to get down on the ground. The ground was just as dirty as the air, so Gradient couldn't really care less. Walking up to the small spot, she crouched down and looked into it. The rubble formed a small tunnel, leading into the entrance. *Perfect.* She thought. Climbing in, she crawled through the dusty tunnel, her cybernetic arms scraping against the sides. It was barely enough space for her. After about a minute of crawling, she stopped, and turned on her radio. "Kellien," She announced, "I'm about to enter the Pierce Building. Can you notify Palmer, please?" The radio crackled, and, briefly she heard Kellien's response. "Yeah-" *Static.* "-Going-" *More static.* "-him now." *Interference...* She thought to herself, crawling further in. Once she got in, Gradient suspected the radio would completely cut out. She'd be alone. Pulling herself free of the crawl space, Gradient got up. The atrium of the old building was mostly in rubble. Double checking to make sure her radio really didn't work (it didn't), Gradient headed towards the stairs on the far side of the empty atrium. Dust clouds plumed with every step she took. Strangely, she saw dried blood lining most of the floor. 

As she approached the stairs, she saw something much worse. Corpses lined the stairs, mutilated. They were unrecognizable, and decomposing. How long had they been here? Their faces had been smashed in, some of their limbs were missing...it looked as though they had been *food.* Food for something, something that might still be in the building. Gradient guessed these bodies had been sitting here for a couple of weeks. Sidling past them as quietly as she could, Gradient climbed up the stairs. Occasionally, a few steps were missing. She had to jump across the gaps. Climbing up, and up, and up, Gradient finally reached a large reception room, with a lot of open windows. Being higher up, the room had no rubble, but still looked like a mess. Even more so than the atrium, in some ways...newspapers, decades old, were strewn on the floor. Tables were broken, and the reception desk had been...strung to the ceiling, with thick metal wires. Gradient looked up at it, confusion etched into her face. *What the fuck?* She thought to herself. It wasn't the only thing hanging from the ceiling...there were dead potted plants, more corpses...and certain wires didn't even hold anything. There was something else, hidden in a cage of wires, too...she craned her head harder, trying to get a better look. It looked like a mangled skeleton made of metal, much larger and lankier than the average human skeleton. And the more Gradient stared at it, the more she felt uneasy. Something was off with it. Slowly, she unholstered her pistol, switching the safety off. If there was something in the Pierce Building, it wasn't something she wanted to deal with. As she began to back up, she spotted the skeleton move. It twitched with a horrible metallic crunch. It began to struggle, trying to break free of its wires. Gradient's eye went wide as she watched it, rooted to the spot. It moved unnaturally. Suddenly, its head whirled around on its metal neck, and with another crunch, it stared right down at Gradient, with glowing white eyes. Its face - if it was even a face - looked like a metal mask, made by an amateur welder. Its jaw snapped open. *I'm its next prey. But what the fuck even is it?!* Her mind screamed at her, as she suddenly remembered what she was doing. Breaking into a sprint, Gradient barreled back towards the stairs. A loud *CRASH* filled her ears, and she looked behind herself. The *thing* had broken free and hit the floor. Clicking its jaw, it reoriented itself, crackling as it unnaturally flipped its body around and scuttered towards her on all fours. It was *much* bigger than she thought it was.

Turning around and firing off as many shots from her pistol as she could, Gradient thought she'd be able to stop it. But the bullets just bounced off the skeleton's metal parts. She quickly shoved her pistol back into its holster, and unsheathed her specialized CFI-B 3 blade, swinging the blade up just in time for it to interlock with the skeleton's slash, with its long, spindly metal fingers. Using her enhanced cybernetic strength, Gradient pushed the skeleton back, her arms *hissing* with the pressure. It tried to lunge at her again, its jaw opening wide. Gradient leaped out of the way, barely in time. Its spindly fingers scraped her left arm as she ducked into a slide, grinding against the rough floor. Using her blade to pull herself back up, Gradient swiftly deflected the abomination's next attempts to grab her, before thrusting her blade towards its chest. The blade connected, but...nothing happened. It was just stuck in its ribs. Letting go of it, Gradient ducked away - but it was too late. Without a weapon to deflect the thing's attacks, it was able to latch onto her. Clasping her so her arms were pinned to her sides, it lifted her up. But...it didn't do anything. It just stared into her face. Its blank white eyes behind the mask seemed to scan her, while its jaw clicked uncomfortably. Chattering, it pulled her closer. *What...the fuck?!* She thought to herself, beginning to struggle. Its grip was almost *too* strong, and as it brought her closer, Gradient was able to see how *strange* its body was. It was indeed based off of a human's skeletal system, but certain details were warped, or outright wrong. One arm was longer than the other, held together by sharp metal and wires. Its neck was warped, and dented. The entire body didn't look like it was made by a human. It felt as though this thing decided to suddenly start existing, and its body...was its own creation. Struggling harder, Gradient suddenly got an idea. She swung a leg out and latched onto her blade, pulling it out of the skeleton's ribs. She kicked her leg upwards, slamming the blade into the skeleton's jaw. It screeched as the blade broke through the metal, and it let go of Gradient. Dropping to the floor, Gradient pulled herself up, retrieved her blade, and barreled towards the stairs again. For a moment, the thing was distracted. She'd have to get someone else to come and get rid of it. 

As she ran down the stairs, she heard the thing wail, loudly. It screamed at the top of its lungs - if it even had any - before clattering along the floor above. It was horrible. Gradient hated all of it, and as she headed back down the stairs, leaping over the gaps, she couldn't understand why it didn't kill her. She was prey, she guessed, so why had it just stared at her instead? It was like it *recognized* her.

-

Rolling her motorcycle back inside the PALMER-EDEN garage as the sun was beginning to rise, Gradient climbed off and slumped against the wall. She was tired, and felt a slight twinge of confusion running through her. Why send her against that thing? Why send her down into the underground city? Palmer seemed to just...be using her for menial tasks. She got all this special treatment, but then...nothing. She got dirty work. It was like...no, she didn't want to think about it. Palmer had saved her life, he'd said, and she felt indebted to him. Perhaps Palmer thought this was a good enough way to pay that debt, but if that was the case, why not tell her? Gradient continued to sit there, against the wall, in the dark garage. Shadows settled as the sun lowered, and her mind faded away. For minutes on end, her mind was blank. Nothing went through her head. She was only breathing in, and out, and in again. She closed her eye, beginning to fade into sleep. She felt her fingers twitch, and the veins in her arms returned. She could feel them again...and they hurt. From her elbows down to the tips of her fingers, Gradient felt pain. Pain that was never really there, yet hurt nonetheless. Her body still remembered that she'd had arms, at one point. That was one thing it remembered, that Gradient didn't. The feeling of human skin in her hands. The warmth of another. It was something she could never feel in her hands...yet, somehow, her body still remembered it. There was clearly something behind the thin veil of Gradient's memories, and whatever it was...she couldn't remember properly. Negative feelings broke through the veil occasionally, and images flashed. Blood. Death. Tears falling from her eyes. Gradient couldn't grasp onto them for more than a second, before they faded away. 

As she drifted into sleep, the environment shifted, as her mind settled into sleep. Gradient opened her eye. She knew she was asleep, but vivid dreams like this...she was unable to get out of them. *Great.* Her mind echoed, the word echoing off the invisible walls in the dream. She was sitting in the middle of nowhere, on a road. Grass, something she had never seen in large amounts, covered the landscape, aside from the road. Trees were in the distance, on hills. Above her, the stars and the moon lazily floated. It was clear, clearer than she'd ever seen the world before. But it was just a dream...a lie her brain had created. Getting onto her feet, she continued to look around. The road went off, westward, and in the other way, it went east. It went across hills, before disappearing completely. There were no sounds, other than the quiet rustling of grass and leaves in the wind. Inhaling, she could feel the air. Cool, and fresh. For whatever reason, this was the most vivid dream she'd ever had. Raising a hand into the air and flexing her fingers, she noticed...her hands were made of skin. Her arms were natural...Gradient gasped, which pierced the silence. *My arms...* Her mind echoed, *They're not...metal. What kind of dream...* She thought, examining both of her arms, and her hands. *It's...strange.* She could feel the wind go through her fingers. She could feel her own skin, rubbing her hands together. Blinking, she continued to look around. Turning completely around, she saw something new. A dirt road, heading into the trees. It weaved around the trees, before leading to a large, black silhouette past the trees. If this was a dream, she had nothing better to do. Gradient began to walk down the dirt road path, as the silence pressed against her ears more. The grass and the leaves rustling was calming, but those being the only noises...it made Gradient uneasy. 

As she got closer to the silhouette, she noticed that it was a house. A house, in the middle of nowhere...the lights were all off. It sat there, quietly. Foreboding. Gradient walked up the steps of the porch, slowly. The boards creaked under her feet. The house looked decades old, yet was still standing. It being a dream, Gradient assumed it was just something her brain had made up...but something about it had a strange, nostalgic feeling. Walking up to the front door, Gradient slowly grabbed the door handle. The cold metal touched her hand, as she grabbed onto the handle. Gradient opened the door carefully, looking inside. The interior was just as dark as the outside, with no lights. The only reason she could see was because of the moon shining through the windows, and as she stepped inside, Gradient's foot hit something on the floor, just in front of the door. *What the...* Her mind echoed, looking down. Her eyes met a corpse on the floor, and Gradient felt herself plummet suddenly, the gravity pressing in on her. She stumbled, *What the fuck...?!* she thought, grabbing onto the door to steady herself, *It's a...it's a corpse. Whose?* Her mind swirled with possibilities. It had to just be something her mind had made up, surely..bBut as she regained her stability, and stepped over the corpse, she was suddenly stopped. Frozen. The rewinding of an ancient tape recorder filled her ears, turning back, and back, and back...in front of Gradient, a figure suddenly appeared, shrouded in shadow. It looked like a girl...an adult, barely, perhaps. She was frozen too, lunging towards the corpse. And when Gradient managed to turn her head around, she saw something unsettling...the corpse on the ground had gotten back up, but...there were three more figures, holding pistols. They had clearly shot the corpse...it must've been how they died. As Gradient tried to figured out what was happening, something outside her head suddenly echoed.

*"MOM!"*

It was her own voice.

And suddenly, Gradient opened her eyes. She was awake again. Sweat was rolling down her face, and she was shaking.

Why was she shaking?

#### CODENAME GRADIENT

Gradient was eating her lunch in her quarters, staring out the window. Planes were flying overhead, which was a rarity to see. Most of them seemed to be heading out of the country: the country of Illinois, a conglomeration of a few old US states. It was the only place still structured enough to survive. The Southern States, so she'd heard, were decimated. Nobody lived there, and Palmer told her that one day, he'd get her to go down there. But whatever that might be for, Gradient didn't know, and as she continued to eat, something clawed at her in the back of her mind. That dream. For a moment, it felt so real. But Gradient had no mother, she had no life before this. But it was clearly her voice. She assumed her mind had just made it up, but it felt too specific to be made up...three gunmen gunning down someone's mother in her own home. It stirred something deep in Gradient. *It's a lie.* Her mind echoed. *It's a lie you made up. It has to be...* But it *couldn't* be. It made her feel something, deep in her stomach. It had to be real...the question was just, "who was it real for"? Gradient was certain it wasn't her, but it was her own voice...her mind was going in circles. It's her, it's not her, it's her, it's not her. It wouldn't stop. She'd *force* it to stop. Getting up, Gradient kicked one of the legs of her table, feeling anger bubble inside her. *Stop it. Stop. No more.* She told herself, walking towards the large windows. *You've got things to do today, and it won't do you any good to mull over a stupid dream.* Gradient closed her eyes, breathing slowly. After a few seconds of her eyes being shut, she noticed something. A glint that pierced through her eyelids. A reflection from the sun. Quickly, she opened her eyes and began to scan to buildings. *A reflection...it flickered, slightly...* It could be a sniper. She snatched her binoculars off of a nearby table and held them up to her eye. Gradient scanned the rooftops, and spotted the reflection again. She focused in on the spot, adjusting her binoculars' focus. As it focused in on the reflection, Gradient saw it. A sniper rifle, peeking through a window. And behind it, in the shadows of the crumbling building, was a man wielding it. He was wearing military gear, but it clearly wasn't PALMER-EDEN gear, as it was appropriately coloured for the environment. Desert camouflage. 

*Shit.* She realized, pulling her binoculars down and throwing them on the table, *he was aiming at me. That's not good. That's...really bad, actually.* Gradient ducked down behind the windows, *I've got to find them. I'll get rid of them, easy as that. These have to be spies, watching the tower.* It was obvious. They wanted something from Palmer, didn't they? Gradient would take this matter into her own hands, at least for a moment. Sliding over to her quarters' door, she quickly left. It took her a good twenty minutes, but she was outside, with all of her gear on. Gradient tightened her watch and checked her minimap that usually displayed on the watch. The building she'd spotted the sniper in had been an old grocers'. Eastward. She hadn't brought her Hammerhead bike, but she didn't need it. The trek wasn't far, and as she started heading towards the building, Gradient carefully watched it. The barrel of the sniper rifle wasn't visible out of the window, but as she entered through the main doors, she realized why. The man wielding the rifle had already made his way to the first floor, and was standing at the far end of the empty room. It wasn't just him, however. Several more figures surrounded Gradient, from each corner of the room. They had rifles in their hands, raised at Gradient. She could see that she had no clear way out, and instead of bolting, she slowly unsheathed her sword, which gave a sharp, piercing noise as it left its sheathe. Raising it slowly, Gradient kept her eye trained on the man with the sniper rifle. "Who are you?" She asked, simply. The man lifted his gas mask off his face, strapping it to his vest instead. "Good question." He said, "Captain Elias of HEART squad 34." *Heart?* Gradient thought. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Gradient." He continued, and Gradient felt her whole body go into shock for a moment. "How the fuck...?!" She spat, pulling herself away and raising her blade defensively. "Oh, fuck," Elias said, "Sorry. Hang on, everybody stand down. I forgot - we're supposed to look nice." He muttered, slinging his rifle over his shoulder. The rest of the squad lowered their weapons, aswell. "We're not here to kill you." He explained, unconvincingly. Gradient refused to believe they weren't here for no reason. "Why then? Why are you here?!" Gradient spat. Elias sighed. He looked surprisingly young, perhaps in his twenties. His skin was clean, he had slight stubble around his jaw, and he looked tired. "Well..." He started, "I don't know if you're going to believe us." He sounded unsure of himself. Gradient slowly lowered her blade...

"Believe what?" She asked, quietly. Elias' eyes flicked around the room for a moment... "Martin Palmer. He's not who you think he is." He said, simply. "Bullshit." Gradient said, "I know what he's like. He's-" But Elias cut her off, "He's killing hundreds of people every month. I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but in this climate, it's far more than it feels." He said, speaking over Gradient. "That's not-" Gradient sputtered, but again, she was cut off. Elias suddenly broke into a walk towards her, and said, "I read your case file, Gradient. I know you believe he saved your life, but that's not true." Those words broke through Gradient for a moment, and she lowered her blade. "...What?" She asked, bewildered. Elias stopped, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Okay...listen." He started, "If you could just sit down with us for a moment, I can explain what happened to you. I've..." He paused, "...I've even got your real name, and your past, Gradient." Her eye went wide. "You've got...?" She sputtered, getting more and more confused by the moment. It felt like her mental wall had been shattered. "Just sit down for a moment, and I *swear,* we can figure this out." Elias said. He wasn't completely trustworthy, but the curiosity in Gradient had gotten the better of her, for now. Slowly, she relinquished from her defensive stance and sheathed her blade with a soft *click.* "Fine." She said. "But...if you're lying..." she quietly muttered, "Yeah, yeah, we know." Elias said, waving his hand. "Come on." And then, he walked upstairs. Gradient, looking back, reluctantly followed. If what Elias was saying was true, then Gradient might be able to understand who she was. And if she was still that person...Elias forced open a door on the second level of the building, and walked in. He sat down at a small table that the HEART team had clearly set up. It looked like they even lived here: sleeping bags lined the edges of the room, and lamps sat on the floor. The room itself, like every other one in Chicago, was extremely dilapidated. The floor was cracked, there were holes in the ceiling...cracks in the walls, aswell. Everything not nailed down had already been taken. Slowly, Gradient took a seat opposite of Elias. "...Can I ask a question, first?" Gradient asked.

"Sure. Fire away." Elias said. Gradient uncomfortably watched him for a moment, before asking, "What is *HEART?*" and when she asked that, she saw Elias smile. "Sorry...should've said. HEART stands for Hammerhead Evasion And Reconnaissance Team." *Hammerhead?* Her mind echoed. *Like my bike...which Palmer said they bought from Hammerhead...* "Hammerhead..." She repeated. "I've...I've got a bike from them." She said. Elias nodded, "We know. Palmer stole a whole ships' worth of our stuff. You're wearing one of our recon vests, actually." He said, pointing at the combat vest Gradient had on. "He's been running out of supplies, so instead...he's just been taking them from people who really need them. Including us." That wasn't possible...was it? It couldn't be. She was sure. "That's not right. He said he bought-" Gradient tried to say, but yet again, Elias cut her off. He stood up from his chair, and firmly said, "He lied." Gradient stared up at him, lips sealed. Slowly, he sat back down, "...Sorry." He muttered, "Alright, do you want to know?" She sat there, looking at him. Gradient had realized that, suddenly, she wasn't sure. This was all too sudden... "I-..." She mumbled. "No?" Elias asked. Gradient's mind was swirling in confusion, she wasn't sure whether or not to say yes. It was true that she'd be able to find out who she was, but she was beginning to feel uncertain that she even wanted to know. "...Why would I want to know?" She asked Elias. He crossed his arms, and sighed. "Palmer's erased your memories. He took your entire life away." He said. "If that's not enough for you to say yes, then I'm starting to think you're a lost cause." She was *not* a lost cause. Gradient bit back a retort, and instead responded, "Fine. But don't expect me to give a shit." Elias laughed, "Alright. Alright..." He slowly pulled out a few pictures from his vest, putting them on the table face down. "You sure?" He asked. "Yes." Gradient hissed. 

"Your name." Elias began. "Your name was Cisila Jane Siveta." Gradient blinked. The name seemed to pierce a hole in her veiled memory. "What the..." She muttered. "You were twenty." Elias continued, "When Palmer ruined your life. And then, at twenty-five, he almost killed you. Ever wondered why you arms are cybernetic?" He cocked his head at her arms, "...I- yes, sometimes." Gradient admitted. "He tore them off. After killing your friends." He continued to say, leaning forward and clasping his arms together. "In twenty thirty five, only a few months before the civil war. He put you on ice for almost forty years, Cisila." 

Cisila.

Cisila.

*Cisila.*

That wasn't right. That wasn't her name. "Don't call me that." She muttered. "That's...that's not my name." Elias paused, "...It is, though...?" He said, unsure. "No." Gradient said, in a monotone. "I don't have a name." Elias stared at her, before inhaling. "Yes. Right. Sorry..." He muttered, "Here, I've got some pictures of- of you, before all this." He pulled one of the pictures up, flipped it over, and slid it across the table towards Gradient. She picked it up slowly, staring at it. It was an old photo, and it was like looking in a mirror, albeit a mirror that turned back time. The girl in the picture, the one with the brown hair, was obviously her. A waft of hair covered the right side her face, and freckles ran across the bridge of her nose and her upper cheeks. Her visible eye, the same one Gradient still had, was the same colour. A large pair of scars that looked like tears in her skin were visible in the photo. Gradient raised her hand to her cheek, where the scars would be on her. She felt a slight difference in her skin. The scars were still there. "I...huh." She muttered. "I-" Gradient tried to find the words, but nothing would come out of her mouth. Elias wasn't lying...it was clearly her. But...it wasn't. She wasn't this girl anymore. Gradient was someone else, now. Slowly, she set the picture down. Something was bubbling inside of her, a confused mess of emotions... "I don't want to see more." She said quietly. "I...I think I understand now. I'm leaving." She suddenly got up, and Elias looked up at her. "Hang on-" He sputtered, jumping up, "Just a second, please." Gradient stared at him, "Do you believe me?" He asked. "...I kind of- have to..." She muttered, fidgeting with her fingers. Something felt off with her, all of a sudden. "Palmer- he- he really lied to me?" She asked quietly. "...Yes." Elias said. "And if you don't think my explanation was good enough...there's a file on you, up in the Skyscraper's Eden Archives."

Gradient met his eyes again. "...How do you even...know all of this?" She asked carefully.

"Hammerhead's got its ways." He replied. "I hope...you'll come and find us again. Once you realize what Palmer's done."

Gradient turned away, and began to leave the building. It was a polite gesture, offering for her to join...but she wouldn't. If this was all true, she was going straight to Palmer, and asking him. The truth wouldn't elude her. 

She would force it of Palmer if she had to. Gradient couldn't go on without understanding what really happened. And Palmer *had* to have the answers...not some random Hammerhead operator.

Gradient quietly entered the Eden Archive room, watching carefully to make sure no guards were around. It was eleven at night, and the Archive room was empty. Cardboard boxes upon boxes sat in the corners of the room, while large servers stood proudly in the middle of the closed off room. Gradient walked between the large stacks of boxes, looking in them for folders. Most of the folders inside them were empty, but still had titles. Old police evidence folders, seized once the entire Chicago PD force was closed down twenty years ago. There had been no use for them, once PALMER-EDEN had shut down Chicago completely. Scrounging through some of the other boxes, she found more folders. *Nevada Incident,* one was labelled. Opening it, Gradient flipped through it. Papers upon papers of reports on a classified incident that happened in Nevada, in twenty thirty five, only a few months before Florida launched its attack on the upper states. She squinted at one of the low resolution pictures printed out on one of the reports...mangled corpses, in a pile. Burning. Soldiers who had died during the incident, Gradient assumed. She put the folder back into the box it came from, and moved on. The amount of boxes was staggering, it was as if the Eden Archive room was nothing *but* these boxes, and the servers in the centre. It was like they'd just moved in...sighing, Gradient opened another box. And inside, she saw what she was looking for. She felt her stomach drop. One of the folders inside the box was labelled "Siveta". So the Hammerhead operator wasn't lying...pullign it out, Gradient opened it. The first picture inside the folder was clearly of her, but similar to the one that Captain Elias had shown her. The hair covering half of her face, the harsh scar on the left jaw, scraping up the cheek...Gradient felt something stir inside of her. Confusion, and sadness? It wasn't clear. Her mind was muddy enough as is, and having the confusing prospect of her entire life being someone else...it scared her.

She flipped through the folder, reading small snippets from reports. At the very end, the last paper had something tacked onto it. *Refer to Project GRADIENT for details following cryo program.* 

Gradient slowly put the folder down, closing it. She inhaled, and exhaled. This could *not* be true. She turned away quickly, pushing it all out of her mind. It didn't matter to her. She wasn't that person in the picture anymore. She wasn't someone named Cisila, she didn't *have* a name. She was just Codename Gradient. Her entire life now was just survival, and to her, it was all she needed. And then she remembered...there was someone who wanted to meet her. Someone who knew Cisila...herself, before all of this. Gradient wasn't sure she wanted to. It felt like meeting the past would only end badly. But, on the other hand, she was interested in seeing who Cisila was. What she meant. And why she was turned into Gradient. Turning away from the box, she decided to clock out for the night. There was nothing left for her to do. But as she walked back towards the room's entrance, she saw someone leaning against the door, waiting for her. Gradient froze, her eye locked onto the figure. It was *Palmer.* "Good evening," He muttered. "I was wondering where you were, y'know." He pulled himself up and calmly walked towards Gradient, hands in his coat pockets. "What are you doing up here?" Palmer asked, quietly. Gradient just stared at him, unwilling to answer. "We were in the middle of renovations..." He said, putting a hand on a box. "It's unfortunate that you had to waltz in here, while everything was unsecured." Palmer cocked his head at Gradient, before saying, "But I guess you being in here means you've already figured it out, am I correct?". Gradient stared at him, before slowly nodding. "You're not who you thought you were," Palmer said. "I didn't think you'd be smart enough to find out...but again, you caught us at a bad time." He walked closer to her, his hand sliding off the box. His glasses had a small crack through them, and his face was tired. He still looked like he was in his forties, yet he had to be nearly eighty. 

"You owe me answers." Gradient said. Palmer chuckled, "That so?" He latched onto Gradient's shoulder calmly, "I don't think I do, Gradient." He lowered his voice, his tone becoming more serious. "I understand the confusion you're feeling, but you know, deep down, none of this matters to you." It was true. It didn't matter to her - she wasn't this Cisila girl. But she still felt like she owed some kind of debt to the girl, to solve why this had happened to her. Something deep inside the recesses of her mind told her to investigate it. To question Palmer. After seeing tangible, real evidence that she had been someone else, Gradient felt herself breaking out of the mold of the status quo. Gradient stared into his eyes, while his face was shrouded in the shadow of the dark room. Slowly, but deliberately, Gradient grabbed his arm and forced him to let go of her shoulder. Her cybernetic hand's grip on his arm was tight, to the point that it had to hurt. She watched his expression flinch, as he tugged his arm away, relinquishing Gradient's grip. "It might not matter to me, sir," Gradient muttered, "But that doesn't mean I don't care." She attempted to walk past him and to the door, but as soon as she got past him, he firmly said, "Stop." And, her muscle memory forced her to freeze. He had his authoritative voice on. She looked back at him, and he turned towards her. "I didn't say you could leave." He spat. Anger seemed to be rising from him, radiating like the sun. Gradient hadn't listened to him, and clearly, he wasn't used to it. "Turn around, and face me, Gradient." He said. She reluctantly obliged, turning to face him. "There a problem, sir?" She asked quietly. He rubbed his face slowly, "I can't let you leave this room knowing who you used to be." He told her. "That's too bad, sir," Gradient said, "because I knew before I came in here." Palmer's eyes focused on her, and his brow furrowed. "What?" He muttered. Palmer suddenly lowered his hand and pulled something out from his pocket. "...So you heard from someone else?" He asked.

Gradient was smart enough to lie to him. Hammerhead's appearance in Chicago couldn't be known to him, and because of Palmer's behaviour...Gradient didn't feel like telling him. "No, sir...she used to live in this city, didn't she? I found her apartment." She said, simply. Palmer nodded, "I'm sure you did." and he lifted the thing he retrieved from his pocket towards Gradient. She stared at it, and her eye flicked from it to Palmer. Still frozen in place, she wasn't quite sure what to do. Her brain was fighting itself, one side was telling her to run, but the other was telling her to stay. One told her Palmer was doing the wrong thing, and the other told her to listen. It gave her a migraine. And after what felt like an eternity of standing there, staying at Palmer, her brain told her to listen to him. It told her to relent. And she did. Palmer cocked his head again, "You didn't. I'm well aware you went nowhere near the apartment. What you did do was head towards an old grocer's. What was that about?" He hissed. Gradient felt her lip twitch. There was a silence. "I asked...*what was that about?"* He hissed again. Gradient shook her head, "It was nothing-" She sputtered, "I just...I saw something, and I-" But she was cut off by an immense pain that shot down through her spine. Her eye went wide, and she opened her mouth to scream. "We're not dumb." He said, seeming to completely ignore Gradient's pain. "We know there were people in that building. Who were they, Gradient?" Gradient shut her mouth tight, clenching her teeth together. The pain flowed through her spine, seeming to make its way through her entire body. And suddenly, there was another burst of pain. Exploding through her spine, the piercing feeling of needles suddenly made its way into her very nerves. The burst made its way through her entire nervous system, and she screamed. It even made its way into her cybernetics...someone she had never felt before. It got worse every second. Every second became eternity. Palmer wanted answers, and for whatever reason, he was willing to put Gradient in extreme pain. But the pain wasn't going to make her answer.

The pain had just answered her questions. The pain told her Palmer couldn't be trusted. He walked even closer, and raised his voice. "Who were they?!" He asked again. Gradient refused to answer, fighting through the pain, and still standing. Her eye met Palmer's, and there seemed to be a flash of something behind his eyes. She screamed again when the pain ramped up even more, piercing through her entire body. And suddenly, it made its way back up her spine and seemed to go into her very mind. Her thought process completely shut down, and her mind, for a brief moment, shut off. The only thing left was the pain. And when her brain shut down, her entire body seemed to fritz out. Gradient lost control of her appendages, and she saw, through her blurring eye, that her cybernetic hands were twitching uncontrollably, and the panels were clicking. Her body had lost control of the cybernetics. Her body had lost control of everything. Gradient's ears were filled with a loud, migraine inducing buzzing. Her entire existence had been reduced to pain in a flash, and she couldn't get out of it. It felt like an eternity. Everything hurt. Everything. Palmer was a blurry mess in her vision, and she figured she was crying. The pain had now reached the core of her brain, and she finally collapsed, her legs unable to keep her standing. On the ground, unable to stop herself, her body began to convulse and twitch horribly. Gradient must have been screaming aswell, but she couldn't hear it. The only thing in her hearing was the buzzing. The high pitched screech. Everything was beginning to go numb. She'd forgotten where she was. She'd forgotten who she was. The only thing in her entire existence was pain. But something suddenly broke through the pain. *"So that's who they are."* Palmer's voice echoed. Her body stopped convulsing. Her mind switched back on. She was back on the floor of the Eden Archive room, and she was Gradient. Sweating profusely, Gradient tried to pull herself up. She was shaking. "Thank you." Palmer said. "I see...alright." He was turned away from Gradient, on the phone. Had she just...answered? She couldn't have. Gradient didn't hear herself say anything...but she must have...and then she realized: 

He was *vulnerable.* The pain she had just felt had given way to anger. Gradient felt furious. How could he do this to her? How could he torture her, when he called Gradient one of his most valuable soldiers? She felt a sudden burst of adrenaline when she realized she could *leave.* There was somewhere she could go. If she could just get out of the Eden Skyscraper, she could find the HEART team again. She pulled herself up, and in the shadows, she slowly unsheathed her blade, silently walking towards Palmer. "I understand. Yes, look, I've got to go." He said to the person on the phone. "Good. Yes, good. I'll see you tomorrow morning, then. Yes." He paused, listening. "Goodbye." He said, hanging up. And the moment he hung up, Gradient swung her blade down onto Palmer, but in a flash, he disappeared. Her blade hit the floor with a *clang,* and Gradient felt confused. Behind her, Palmer suddenly appeared and roundhouse kicked her in the back of her head, sending Gradient flying. Dropping her blade, she slammed straight into a stack of boxes, crushing most. "I see how it is." Palmer announced, cracking his knuckles. "Shit...!" Gradient sputtered, scrambling back up. He was blocking the exit. There was only one way past him. Her fists. She clenched her metal fists and raised them, recalling her hand-to-hand training from Kellien. Palmer seemed to laugh, "You're going to fight me with your fists?" He asked. "Those things weren't built to withstand punches, you know." And he smoothly slid into his fighting stance. Gradient took a few steps, beginning to circle Palmer. Palmer too, circled. "You think you're capable of hitting me?" He asked. "Gradient, you're only here because I saved you." Gradient's lip twitched. "You *liar...*" She hissed. The folder, of course, had outlined exactly what Elias had said. Palmer had killed Cisila's friends, and ripped her arms off. "Perhaps I shouldn't have woken you up..." Palmer said, "You're more of a liability than I thought..."

*A liability...* Gradient's mind echoed. "You motherfucker." She spat. "You tore her life away, and replaced it with me. What kind of *fucking* psychopath are you?!" Palmer stared her in the eyes. "If she didn't die, the country would've collapsed. Imagine if she killed me. There would be no Illinois. We wouldn't be alive..." But that was a lie. Hammerhead wasn't an Illinois company. They didn't come from anywhere in Illinois, either...this was it. The last straw. Palmer had not only ripped someone's life away, he was actively destroying others with his lies. Nobody had been able to get into Illinois in years, and Gradient had assumed this was for a valid reason...but it was a lie, she realized. It was all a lie. "You have to understand what it takes to save people." Palmer hissed. Gradient spat back, "You locked down a *country,* not letting anyone in or out. What did that do?! What do you *think* it did?!" Palmer laughed, and replied, "The outside is...dangerous. There's nothing out there. It's not livable. We're the only survivors." Gradient's eye twitched, her vision going fuzzy for a moment. Anger was clouding her. She couldn't take it anymore.

"Shut up." She spat. Palmer cocked his head, as the two were still circling. "Excuse me?" He asked. "I said shut up. I've heard enough of your BULLSHIT!" She screamed, and suddenly rushed towards him, leaping into the air, ready to kick him. Palmer reflected this move, seeming to have anticipated it, and leaped into the air aswell. Their kicks met.

Landing on the ground, Gradient attempted to throw the first punch, her metal fist flying straight towards Martin Palmer's face. He swiftly ducked under her hook, slamming his own fist in Gradient's gut, and she felt her entire body lose feeling for a moment as she stumbled, struggling to breathe. Palmer then roundhouse kicked her in the face with such surprising strength that Gradient had no time to get out of the way. The kick sent her straight into the floor, and with barely any time to react, Gradient was barely able to pull herself up. She ducked her head as Palmer attempted to kick her once again, and finally, she jumped up. Blocking one of Palmer's punches, Gradient returned the move with a swift uppercut, connecting with Palmer's jaw. Her metal fist collided with bone, and she felt a small *crack* upon hitting his jaw. He stumbled backwards, and Gradient took her opportunity to deliver a series of swift blows against Palmer, each punch injuring Palmer further. It clearly wasn't enough, and as Palmer suddenly counterattacked, Gradient dodged away as fast as she could, her boots sliding across the smooth floor of the Archives. Palmer lunged forward, his fist going straight for Gradient's face, and ducking to the side, Gradient suddenly pulled her pistol out of its holster, flinging it upwards and pulling the trigger. She knew was dead on, and with a sharp *bang,* the bullet flew straight towards Palmer's head. For a moment, everything seemed to slow down, as the bullet inched closer and closer. But in a flash, Palmer's hand flew up towards the bullet...and to Gradient's dismay, he caught it between his pointer and thumb. He threw the bullet down, and, catching Gradient off guard, swfitly jabbed his fist into her gut, before going straight into an uppercut and punching her towards the glass wall of the Archive room. Dropping her gun, Gradient was now without any weapons. Her blade was still stuck in the ground, and without it, she had no defense. She had to get back to it. *Fuck.* Her mind echoed, and as she dodged around Palmer's kick, she sprinted towards her blade, diving into a slide and latching onto the hilt, tearing it out of the floor and slamming the sharp edge against it to slow herself down. The metal scraped against the floor, sparking. "Smart cookie." Palmer said, as Gradient jumped up, twirling her blade. "But it won't be enough." 

Gradient rushed towards Palmer, letting the blade scrape against the floor. Leaping into the air once more, Gradient was set on ending Palmer. But as she brought the blade down on him, she felt everything slow down again. Palmer was making direct eye contact with her, and he raised his arm in defense, and as the blade touched it...the entire blade shattered. Cracks climbed through the sleek metal, and slowly, the sharp pieces of metal went flying. It was like Palmer was built to be invincible. As the blade shattered, time moved normally, and Palmer swiftly caught Gradient by her neck, whipped her around, and pitched her straight towards the glass wall. Slamming into it and cracking it slightly, Gradient fell to the floor, trying to catch her breath. She looked up at Palmer, sweating. "...What...the hell are you made of?" She muttered. He looked down at her, saying nothing. Instead, he latched onto her head, and she suddenly felt her stomach drop. *Oh, no.* "This will kill you." He said. "Do you have anything to say for yourself?" Gradient looked up at him, "No. If you're going to kill me just like this, then I wasn't worth anything to begin with." She said, through gritted teeth. Palmer grumbled, and slammed her head against the glass wall. It cracked further with a horrible crackling noise. And then again. Gradient felt the pain. The glass cracked even further, until the fourth time. Her head went straight through the glass as the wall shattered with a horribly loud *crash.* And as her head went through, Palmer let go. Her entire body fell through the gap in the wall, straight out into the outside. She began to plummet. Blood was trailing down her head, glass shards had pierced her shoulders. In freefall, Gradient whipped around to try and find some way to stop herself. She wasn't sure how long she had until she hit the ground, and until then, she could still live. She wouldn't die like this. *But without any weapons - I'm screwed.* Her mind echoed, as she desperately looked around, still plummeting. 

Suddenly, everything began to slow down. Everything shifted into a blue haze. *Oh, shit.* Gradient realized. Her freefall began to slow down, as if she was floating in a thick gel that didn't want to let go. Her entire body froze in the air, as did the twinkling stars above the half dead city. *"I said you can't die."* A voice echoed, everywhere around her, yet nowhere. *"You need something, don't you?"* It seemed to ask her. *No. No, I can get out of this myself. I don't need help.* She tried to think, at the voice. From behind her, the glowing blue figure floating out, as stiff as a board. It was still seemingly digital, made of polygons. It flipped itself upwards and pointed at her with a blocky finger. Its figure was still a basic human's silhouette, but unlike before, it seemed to have been made from more polygons. *"Your arm. Your left arm."* It echoed, pointing at it. *"Martin experimented with your former abilities...he tinkered, until he was able to recreate one."* Gradient's eye, the only thing still able to move, flicked downwards, looking at her left cybernetic arm. *"Activation code CS-033 activates your grapple gun, implanted in your arm. It has enough of a cable to be able to stop your fall."* It floated away from her, *"I can't help you too much. But at the very least, I cannot let you die."*

*What do you mean?* Gradient desperately thought at it. *"I mean you still have a purpose in life, sweetheart."* It answered. *"I can't save you from everything, though. I'm not really here."* And slwoly, it began to fade away. Gradient felt herself beginning to fall again, and in desperation, she tried to reach out towards the glowing figure. But as it disappeared, instead of being able to grab onto it, Gradient's arm began to change form. Panels slid apart, and as they did, some kind of grappling system put itself together, wrapping around her arm. Clenching her hand into a fist, she watched as the figure disapperaed completely, and time resumed. Gradient fired the grapple as soon as she could, and it latched onto the side of the Eden Skyscraper. It immediately slowed her down, and because of how far she'd fallen, she was quickly able to descend to the ground. But just a few dozen metres above the ground, there was the distinct booming *crack* of a sniper rifle, far above her, and the cable snapped in two with a distinct *zip* noise, and what was left of it slid straight back into the grapple. 

Gradient plummeted to the ground, but at least at this height, she'd survive.

But, in her desperate attempt to survive, she'd missed the fact that the figure's time freeze...had shunted her forwards. Far much more than a few hours.

#### CODENAME GRADIENT

Gradient woke up face down, on the ground. The cracking pavement was warm. The sun beat down on her back. Her breathing was steady. But something felt off...her emotions stirred as she realized that the environment around her wasn't Chicago. Confusion seemed to bubble inside her, and as she opened her eye, Gradient tried to pull herself up. Her arms felt weak, and drowsiness lay on her like a heavy mist. Inhaling deeply, she slowly pulled herself up. As she got up, Gradient looked around herself. Unbelievably, she was in the middle of nowhere. There wasn't a skyscraper in sight...or, in fact, any human. In Chicago, there was still a lot of people. Most streets still had stores open, even electricity...it was just the centre of the city, where the Eden Skyscraper was, that had nobody in it- outside of the Skyscraper, that is. Gradient grumbled, running her metal hands through her hair. The blood running down the side of her head had dried. The glass shards were still in her shoulders, but she easily pulled them out after a couple minutes of fiddling. Throwing the tiny pieces to the paved road, she sighed. Gradient had somehow ended up in the middle of nowhere, and wherever she looked, she could only see desert. Collapsed buildings, like old gas stations. Homes that were vacated long, long ago. The sky was violently blue, with only the pitiful wisps of clouds floating above her. Silently, Gradient dug through her gear, trying to find anything she could use, still. Her water bottle was gone. A few of her other tools had disappeared, aswell. The only thing she still had was her radio, attached to her vest. But it probably wouldn't be useful to her, not being able to get a hold of anybody from PALMER-EDEN...she was probably declared dead, or, in a worse scenario, she was called a traitor and ordered to be shot on sight. What still eluded her was the fact that Palmer, for some reason, had ever decided to keep her around. If she wasn't useful, then why was she alive? He had clearly gotten what he wanted from the Cisila girl, so there was no reason to tear her memories out and replace her with Gradient. *Maybe he just wanted to get a bit of torture in for revenge,* She thought. Gradient stared up at the sky. *That piece of shit.* Her mind echoed. Small buildings surrounded her, indicating that she had been dumped in some town. There were multiple small stores closest to her, old convenience stores and bookstores.
