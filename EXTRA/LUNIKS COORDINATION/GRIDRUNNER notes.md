### Copy-Pasted from Josie's notes:

- Gridrunners Faction/Organisation: Because of how United M치ne치 was originally built on a grid system, this underground and overground organisation of the cities remained. This gives way to undergrounds handymen to perform under-the-radar operations without being seen or without other companies being able to pick up from.

- "Masked Gang": The subways are their turf (M치ne치n Metro). As a result, Gridrunners frequently avoid doing metro routes as much as possible.

- Palmer-Eden derivative: Currently nameless. This company will be the primary antagonist in the story. This company will derive from Palmer-Eden (Who is in a stranglehold on Earth overseen by the Southern States and Canada) in a similar fashion to Carbine operating under Hammerhead from 2075-2080. This company existing is the primary reason Gradient made her way to Luniks to begin with. (// This does NOT mean that Head To Head can't take place. That takes place in 2075 on Earth.)

- Cloning: Cloning as a concept remains a taboo even in 2090 and onwards. This in turn will connect with the Palmer-Eden derivative. In Cisila's main story, she nearly dies in PART III, and is resurrected by Martin. This creates Gradient. Next to this, currently drafted is that Martin (Or a figure carrying the torch) will utilise Gradient to create a clone of her. This clone becomes Cisila once more as featured in Routine Maintenance.

### New Notes:

The **Palmer-Eden derivative** will have the motto "Alea iacta est", or in English, "The die is cast". This symbolizes how they believe they already have greater control over their area than other companies do. They cast their die first, and they were lucky enough to win.

Possible name for the **Palmer-Eden derivative**... \
"SolarDawn", perhaps stylized more like *SOLAR_DAWN* or *SOLARDAWN* - they are a jack of all trades company, just like PALMER-EDEN, reaching their grimy feelers into every corner that they can. While not as powerful or controlling as the original PALMER-EDEN, they keep a close eye on what happened to Gradient...or perhaps they are the reason she was captured by the strange *Cult of Eden*.
