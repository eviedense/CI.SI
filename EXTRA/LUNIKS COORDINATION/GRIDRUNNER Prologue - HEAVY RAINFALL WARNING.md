It was perhaps the worst storm that the city Amadnésam had suffered through ever. Thick droplets of water pounded the windows of every building, and in every ditch and crevice, large puddles of water were forming, constantly rippling from the relentless rain coming down from above. The skyscrapers, towers, and all the smaller buildings in Amadnésam were drenched in water. But on the rooftop of a particular building, sat a figure with a large, bulky sniper rifle on a tripod, aimed towards an apartment building on the adjacent block. Its scope was zeroed in on the only window that had light. The figure themselves wore a large, rustling cloak, which billowed in the heavy winds. Water ran through its many folds. The texture of the cloak made it look shiny, and smooth. Underneath the hood, only a single eye peered out. The other was gone, replaced by a metal apparatus, with no visible lense or way to see, but nonetheless, it stared down the scope of the rifle. Underneath their cloak, they were wearing premier military gear, designed and tailored specifically to them, in all black with hints of a drab purple. The cloak too had purple accenting, but was barely visible in the dark. Below the buildings, the street lights were dim. Nobody was outside. Nobody except for the Gradient. As she stared down the scope of the sniper rifle, she waited, and waited, until suddenly...the radio strapped to her combat vest buzzed. Her real eye flicked down to it and she carefully turned it on. For a very brief moment, static filled her ears as the radio connected to the earpieces she had on. Her radio was connected to a news station at the moment, and she heard a news anchor rattle off about the ongoing weather. *"...weather continues to be bad, specifically in the area around Amadnésam. The rain is projected to continue for another day and a half, so if you need to go out tomorrow, safety is extremely advised. The metro system is the safest way of transportation. However, in recent days, the metro..."* Gradient sighed, and flicked the radio back towards its military configuration. "Wind speeds are going at about 56 kilometres an hour." She reported. The apparatus in her right eye had been measuring wind speeds, rainfall, and everything around for about the past hour as she had sat silently. "It's going to mess up any projectile trajectory." She waited patiently for a response. After a brief moment, the radio crackled to life. *"Yeah."* Said the voice of Lieutenant Kellien. *"Yeah, it's pretty-"* The radio crackled as he spoke, the connection breaking. *"-d. So bad I think it's contributing to our comm problems. Shit..."* He hissed, sighing. *"Keep an eye on our target. SOLARdawn's not going to let us get close to this person again, so if you miss your shot, it's over. Do you remember how to use the rifle, Gradient?"* Kellien pressed, needing to make sure she absolutely knew what she was doing. "I do." Gradient said, pulling the bolt back. There were no real bullets in this rifle. It worked off of technology she wasn't familiar with. "Just like a normal rifle. It just...needs to cool down, right?" She asked. *"Yeah."* Kellien responded, having to raise his voice against the wind and the rain. *"We're keeping an eye on every other entrance to the building. Nobody's come in or out yet. He's still inside."* He added. \
"Got it." Gradient said, keeping the large rifle trained on the window. Inside this specific room was an office, belonging to a SOLARdawn employee. SOLARdawn, on the surface, appeared to be like any company on Lúniks. Proud, modern, and always innovating. But HEART and Gradient had discovered that they weren't all what they seemed. Somehow, over the years, PALMER-EDEN had found its way to Lúniks, in an altered, mutated form. SOLARdawn. 

The employee they were going after had something they needed, and they could only get it by killing him. There was no way for them to leave him alive without creating a possible leak in their plans. If the man said anything, it would likely be over. They needed the man's BioCard, to access the SOLARdawn facility in Amadnésam.
