It was perhaps the worst storm that the city Amadnésam had suffered through ever. Thick droplets of water pounded the windows of every building, and in every ditch and crevice, large puddles of water were forming, constantly rippling from the relentless rain coming down from above. The skyscrapers, towers, and all the smaller buildings in Amadnésam were drenched in water. But on the rooftop of a particular building, sat a figure with a large, bulky sniper rifle on a tripod, aimed towards an apartment building on the adjacent block. Its scope was zeroed in on the only window that had light. The figure themselves wore a large, rustling cloak, which billowed in the heavy winds. The cloak only reached down to her waist, covering her from her head to her wrists. Water ran through its many folds. The texture of the cloak made it look shiny, and smooth. Underneath the hood, only a single eye peered out. The other was gone, replaced by a metal apparatus, with no visible lense or way to see, but nonetheless, it stared down the scope of the rifle. Underneath their cloak, they were wearing premier military gear, designed and tailored specifically to them, in all black with hints of a drab purple. The cloak too had purple accenting, but was barely visible in the dark. Below the buildings, the street lights were dim. Nobody was outside. Nobody except for the Gradient. As she stared down the scope of the sniper rifle, she waited, and waited, until suddenly...the radio strapped to her combat vest buzzed. Her real eye flicked down to it and she carefully turned it on. For a very brief moment, static filled her ears as the radio connected to the earpieces she had on. Her radio was connected to a news station at the moment, and she heard a news anchor rattle off about the ongoing weather. *"...weather continues to be bad, specifically in the area around Amadnésam. The rain is projected to continue for another day and a half, so if you need to go out tomorrow, safety is extremely advised. The metro system is the safest way of transportation. However, in recent days, the metro..."* Gradient sighed, and flicked the radio back towards its military configuration. "Wind speeds are going at about 56 kilometres an hour." She reported. The apparatus in her right eye had been measuring wind speeds, rainfall, and everything around for about the past hour as she had sat silently. "It's going to mess up any projectile trajectory if I don't make any adjustments." She waited patiently for a response. After a brief moment, the radio crackled to life. *"Yeah."* Said the voice of Lieutenant Kellien. *"Yeah, it's pretty-"* The radio crackled as he spoke, the connection breaking. *"-d. So bad I think it's contributing to our comm problems. Shit..."* He hissed, sighing. *"Keep an eye on our target. SOLARdawn's not going to let us get close to this person again, so if you miss your shot, it's over. Do you remember how to use the rifle, Gradient?"* Kellien pressed, needing to make sure she absolutely knew what she was doing. "I do." Gradient said, pulling the bolt back. There were no real bullets in this rifle. It worked off of technology she wasn't familiar with. "Just like a normal rifle. It just...needs to cool down, right?" She asked. *"Yeah."* Kellien responded, having to raise his voice against the wind and the rain. *"We're keeping an eye on every other entrance to the building. Nobody's come in or out yet. He's still inside."* He added. \
"Got it." Gradient said, keeping the large rifle trained on the window. Inside this specific room was an office, belonging to a SOLARdawn employee. SOLARdawn, on the surface, appeared to be like any company on Lúniks. Proud, modern, and always innovating. But HEART and Gradient had discovered that they weren't all what they seemed. Somehow, over the years, PALMER-EDEN had found its way to Lúniks, in an altered, mutated form. SOLARdawn. 

The employee they were going after had something they needed, and they could only get it by killing him. There was no way for them to leave him alive without creating a possible leak in their plans. If the man said anything, it would likely be over. They needed the man's BioCard, to access the SOLARdawn facility in Amadnésam. Under the cover of the rain and night, HEART was going to kill him. And just as her mind turned to SOLARdawn again, Gradient spotted something through the scope. It was the man entering his office. "Shit-" She spat. "He's in." Tightly holding onto the rifle, she pulled the bolt back fully and slammed it forward. The rifle whirred and she felt the entire thing warm up briefly. A couple heat vents warmed to the point that they began to glow. *"Positions, everybody."* Kellien commanded. *"She's about to take the shot. If we don't get in there ASAP, somebody'll find him."* \
Gradient settled her finger on the trigger as she aimed the rifle along the path the man was taking to his chair. It would be easier once he sat down. Gradient felt as if time had slowed to an agonizing crawl, each step the man took felt as it ran in slow motion. The rain continued to fall harder and harder. But eventually, the man made it to his chair at his desk, and sat down. He leaned back, and seemed to sigh. "Ready." Gradient said, beginning to put pressure on the trigger. The rifle whirred harder, whatever energy was inside began to build up. *"Copy that."* Kellien replied, the wind howling and crackling his mic. *"Fire when ready, Gradient."* And she was. But just before she fully pulled the trigger, the man sat up, seemed to look directly at her, and the blinds to the window autonomously closed. "What the-..." Gradient mouthed silently, sudden panic overcoming her. In a split second, her shot had disappeared. The man had looked right at her, somehow. And then the blinds had shut. But she could still shoot through the blinds. *"Gradient?"* Kellien asked over the radio, *"Gradient, there was no shot. Is everything fine?"* He pressed. She ignored him, and instead pulled the trigger. The rifle's whirring turned into a high-pitched screech as the projectile blasted out of the barrel and towards the blinds. But just before the projectile hit, a second set of blinds, on the exterior of the building, slid shut with a deep *clang* that she could hear through the heavy rain. The bolt of energy hit the metal and dissipated. Gradient had missed her chance. \
But then, somehow, it got ten times worse. "He spotted me. Blinds are closed. Run." She hissed, as quickly as she could. *"What?"* Kellien gasped, before Gradient could hear footsteps from his end of the radio. *"Oh, shit."* he said, despondent. *"Everybody- run. Run!"* Just as fast as Kellien had been found, Gradient too heard footsteps. She immediately let go of her rifle, stood up, and whipped around. The cloak she was wearing flared out as she spun around, droplets of rain flinging out around her. Heavy boots thumped their way up the stairs, and Gradient lowered her cybernetic hand towards the CFI-3 blade fastened to her toolbelt, in its sheathe. Her cold, metal hand rested on the hilt, under the cloak. The rooftop access door that she had come through several hours earlier slammed open and SOLARSec (a SOLARdawn subsidiary) guards rushed out. They were dressed in large tarp-like cloaks to protect against the rain, and most of their gear was hidden underneath them. The SOLARSec logo was plastered over their cloaks, proudly displaying the blazing gold, silver and white logo. Their gear was primarily white aswell, and their shining helmets reflected the lights from above and around the rooftop. Gradient fastened her grip on the hilt, tilting the whole blade forward in its sheathe. She slid her hand down to the sheathe and gripped that instead, allowing her right hand to pull the blade free when needed. *"You're under arrest for breaching SOLARdawn Service Terms, Act four, Article Three-B."* The lead SOLARSec guard rattled off, the helmet's voice manipulator masking their voice with a thick, static-filled drone.

Gradient used her free hand to pinch the bridge of her nose for a second. The cold metal didn't hurt, but it was something she had never gotten used to. She sighed. Instead of surrendering herself, Gradient was going to fight back. Even though not many bothered to fight back against SOLARSec. But today, she couldn't risk it. And so, Gradient swiftly held onto the CFI-3 blade's grip with her right hand, and spread her legs to gain a more balanced offensive stance. The CFI-3 blade made the air around it quiver as it slid out of its sheathe, with a quiet hum. The SOLARSec guards pulled out their own melee weapons. They weren't allowed to use firearms for safety reasons, and for that, they would be easy to take down. With a slick *shing,* the blade left its sheathe and Gradient twirled it around, taking her offensive fighting stance, with both hands holding onto the blade tightly. She held it at shoulder height and the tip of the blade was aimed towards the ground. It would function as a good block if need be. "If you're not going to comply..." The lead SOLARSec guard hissed, and pulled out his own blade. a CFI-2, a slightly less advanced model of Gradient's blade. "Then you are sentenced to death, under Máneá law." *What Máneá law?* Her mind echoed quietly before the guards suddenly rushed towards her, their cloaks billowing out. The rain pounded down on the rooftop as a few of the taller skyscraper's lights flickered. \
The lead guard was the first to strike, bringing his CFI-2 down on Gradient, which she brought her own blade up to block. The blades slammed together with a *clang,* and she immediately felt the strength of the SOLARSec guard push her down. The servos and gears in her two cybernetic arms whirred as she pushed back against it, before slamming her foot into the guard's chest. He stumbled back, and in three swift slices, the man fell apart into three pieces. His blood splattered everywhere, but it was quickly washed up by the heavy rainfall. The other guards looked stunned for a moment, before directly attacking Gradient as retaliation. She kicked away one of them, and deflected the other's attempt at an attack, before being forced to duck backwards, nearly falling over, by the third's roundhouse kick. They were better trained than most, but that wouldn't stop the CFI-3 blade from cutting through them. Stumbling backwards and springboarding herself off of the ledge of the rooftop, Gradient slammed into one of the guards, driving her blade through his stomach. She ripped the blade upwards, through his chest, his neck, and then his head. He fell to the ground and his innards splattered across the roof. Gradient whirled around and blocked the second last guard's next attack, bringing his baton down at her back. Her blade clanged against the baton as she stopped the attack, and kicked him over the edge of the building. His scream was cut short. The last guard cowered in fear. "Don't-" They pleaded, the voice manipulator making their tone sound insincere. Even if they were sincere, they worked for SOLARSec, and had agreed to all of this. Gradient stared down at them, and twirled her blade around before sheathing it. For a brief moment, the last guard's stature looked relieved. But it was only a brief moment, for in a flash, a long, sharp metal blade shot out from Gradient's metal wrist, underneath her palm, with a sleek *shik* noise. Before the guard even realized what was going to happen, the blade had gone straight through their helmet and into their head. Pulling it back, the blade retracted with the same *shik* noise. Gradient turned on her radio, "It's SOLARSec." She said, to anyone who may have been listening. "It looks like they figured out what we were doing. There was a leak." \
*"I figured!"* Kellien said, panting. He was running. *"There's no way anyone could've learned of this unless one of us leaked it. And it wasn't you or I, it seems."* He slowed down, catching his breath. *"But you need to run. There's...there's so many of them. I didn't know they had this many personnel."*

There was no way she was going to outrun SOLARSec or SOLARdawn on foot. She needed to get to the degrading metro of Amadnésam, and luckily for her, she knew there was a track nearby from their surveys of the area. As she heard more footsteps, Gradient leaped off the edge of the building, pulled her grapple gun off of her toolbelt, and shot it towards the adjacent building where they had just attempted a hit. The grapple hooked onto the very top of the building and it reeled Gradient up with as much torque as it could muster, and as soon as she reached the top, she cut the cable and broke into a sprint. A few leaps over the next few buildings, and she would reach one of the only exposed metro tracks in the area. One building, then the next, each jump letting her briefly see the neon signs plastered on the thin streets below, each sign encroaching on another's space, fighting for superiority. This part of the city was much, much smaller than the giant skyscrapers looming in the background. With each long jump she took, her cloak billowed into the air, flapping. Slamming her feet against the concrete rooftop of the last building next to the metro, Gradient turned her radio on again. "Can anyone hear me?" She yelled through the wind whipping against her face. Her hood was about to fly off. *"Yes!"* Another HEART member responded, *"And I know where you are-"* Their connection sputtered, the static crackling for a brief moment. *"There's a train about to surface right below where you are. You're right on time!"* Gradient quickly hopped up onto the ledge of the rooftop, staring down at the rectangular opening into the Amadnésam metro system. It was embedded between buildings, something you would only see if you lived in the surrounding buildings. But here, right now, it was her best way out. She heard the yelling of SOLARSec behind her getting louder just as the rattling tracks began to echo off of the walls below. The train was about to pass, and she estimated she had about three seconds of time to jump, and as soon as she jumped...she'd have to duck. The lights of the train filled the opening before it appeared, and with a rush, the train cars began to fly by, the tracks rattling louder and louder. Gradient looked behind herself, and stepped off of the ledge. \
She hit the roof of the train car, and immediately broke into a roll, barely sliding under the tunnel entrance, with her stomach pressed against the roof of the metro train car. *"They're going to start skimming the whole city to look for us."* Kellien said over the radio as Gradient slowly pulled herself across the roof, towards an entrance. *"...And, probably with you, they'll be at every metro station they can find."* Unfortunately, he was right. And Carbine had specifically told them to *not* be seen, if they had to do this mission. That had all gone out the window. But there was nothing Carbine could've done about it...someone had leaked the plans directly to SOLARdawn. *"We have to leave."* Kellien continued. "No." Gradient spat. "No, we *can't.* They're doing something out there, and I need to find out what." If PALMER-EDEN had managed to wriggle its way off of Earth, then they were trying to do something extraordinary. Something horrible, probably. She suspected. Nobody, except for HEART, knew that SOLARdawn was a PALMER-EDEN derivative. Not even Carbine. Not Hammerhead. As she pulled herself down between the train cars, Gradient couldn't help but theorize about what SOLARdawn might have been doing behind their closed doors, with their newfound Lúniksian technology and funding. Everybody believed they were a role model for medical practices and developments...but beneath the surface, something *had* to be going on. They had managed to hide their appearance so well that Gradient had only found out their existence because of some old files hidden in a PALMER-EDEN factory. The occasion briefly flashed through her head as she pulled open a window on the train car and climbed in. 

Pulling it shut, Gradient looked around. The train car was dim, and nobody was inside. It was mostly metallic, and the lights that were on were glowing a soft gold and orange. Turning her radio on again, she spoke into it. "We need to get in there." Gradient said, talking about the SOLARdawn building. It was one of the larger skyscrapers, with the SOLARdawn logo plastered on its side vertically. "Those files I saw..." She began to explain to anyone who was listening. "They said something." Gradient felt her mouth turn into a heavy frown. "They said something about a project, codenamed VIOLET. It had me-" She paused, shaking her head, "-it had the Girl as its primary test subject." The Girl was her previous life. Cisila Jane Siveta. But that life was long gone. She hated even saying the name. It *wasn't* her. "But there is no Girl. Not anymore, at least." The memories of the files flashed through her head. Cryptic explanations of gene coding, and of skin composition. Eye colour. Every detail about the Girl, meticulously written out. Her jaw, her cheekbones...her eyes, her arms. Her fingers. It had to have meant something, instead of being archival purposes. It was *in* a folder titled project VIOLET. *"I understand why you want to get in."* Kellien replied, *"But right now, we've got no chance. Nothing."* She understood that, but she refused to let Martin Palmer stretch his feelers out beyond Illinois. Beyond Earth. He was long dead, yet somehow he seemed to remain alive out of pure vengeance. "But there's got to be *some* way in." Gradient insisted. "They shouldn't be allowed to operate. If someone knew..." \
*"There's no concrete evidence linking them to Palmer. I'm sorry, Gradient, but we would just get laughed out of the room if we tried to imply SOLARdawn was an ancient Earth company that completely shut off most of America to modern companies."* Kellien calmly explained. He seemed to be out of danger's way. *"Just lay it off for now-"* Kellien continued, *"We need to regroup. What's your Sector?"* Gradient quickly checked the watch on her left wrist. Its readout displayed *GRID SECTOR 3-B, METRO*. Relaying this to Kellien, he began to formulate a path to regroup at a safehouse. "You're going to have to get off at the next stop." He began, "The street should be empty, but...I don't know how long you can avoid SOLARSec." And nearly as soon as he explained that, a few of the screens in the train car flickered to life with a warning message. It seemed to have been broadcast citywide. "...Oh, for *fuck's* sake..." Gradient hissed, watching the screens. The warning message read: \
*WARNING - DANGEROUS HOSTILES - STAY INDOORS - IF SPOTTED, CONTACT SOLARSEC - AVOID AT ALL COSTS* \
*KNOWN ASSAILANT DRESSED IN A RAINCLOAK, ALL BLACK, HINTS OF PURPLE. FACE OBSCURED - REPEAT, CONTACT SOLARSEC AND AVOID AT ALL COSTS.* \
They weren't quite PALMER-EDEN, who had an iron grip on an entire country, but SOLARdawn managed to push city officials to label the incident an attack. An emergency. The metro slowly slid to a stop, the wheels screeching. The polite synthesized female voice of the metro calmly explained, *"GRID Sector 3-B. Delcás Square. Thank you for using the Máneá M- Metro. Metro."* It glitched for a moment, repeating the word "metro". The doors slid open, and Gradient quickly got out of the car. Out into Delcás Square, where SOLARSec was surely awaiting her.
