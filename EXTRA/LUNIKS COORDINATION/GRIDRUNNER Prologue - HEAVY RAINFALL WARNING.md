It was perhaps the worst storm that the city Amadnésam had suffered through ever. Thick droplets of water pounded the windows of every building, and in every ditch and crevice, large puddles of water were forming, constantly rippling from the relentless rain coming down from above. The skyscrapers, towers, and all the smaller buildings in Amadnésam were drenched in water. But on the rooftop of a particular building, sat a figure with a large, bulky sniper rifle on a tripod, aimed towards an apartment building on the adjacent block. Its scope was zeroed in on the only window that had light. The figure themselves wore a large, rustling cloak, which billowed in the heavy winds. Water ran through its many folds. The texture of the cloak made it look shiny, and smooth. Underneath the hood, only a single eye peered out. The other was gone, replaced by a metal apparatus, with no visible lense or way to see, but nonetheless, it stared down the scope of the rifle. Underneath their cloak, they were wearing premier military gear, designed and tailored specifically to them, in all black with hints of a drab purple. The cloak too had purple accenting, but was barely visible in the dark. Below the buildings, the street lights were dim. Nobody was outside. Nobody except for the Gradient. As she stared down the scope of the sniper rifle, she waited, and waited, until suddenly...the radio strapped to her combat vest buzzed. Her real eye flicked down to it and she carefully turned it on. For a very brief moment, static filled her ears as the radio connected to the earpieces she had on. Her radio was connected to a news station at the moment, and she heard a news anchor rattle off about the ongoing weather. *"...weather continues to be bad, specifically in the area around Amadnésam. The rain is projected to continue for another day and a half, so if you need to go out tomorrow, safety is extremely advised. The metro system is the safest way of transportation. However, in recent days, the metro..."* Gradient sighed, and flicked the radio back towards its military configuration.
