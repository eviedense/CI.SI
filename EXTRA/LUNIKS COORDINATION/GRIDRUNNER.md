A flash. Blood. Blood *everywhere.* On the walls, the floor...the windows, looking out into space. Bloody handprints smeared across the once pristine glass...and body parts. Mutilated corpses strewn about. Heads torn apart, their brains spilling out like jam. Broken arms, legs...torsos. A walking corpse. So many walking corpses...the worms...the sensation of a skull being crushed underneath her foot. Death. Death everywhere. Death around every corner, inside every crevice of the ship. In the endless cold of deep space. No way out. No way to live. Nowhere to hide. She was going to die here. It was all her fault. \
But then, Cisila bolted upright. She was sitting in her bed. Sunlight was pouring in from the windows of her bedroom. She was hyperventilating, and sweat was running down her forehead. It was cold sweat, and she was absolutely drenched. Looking around her room, she couldn't stop herself from panicking. *You're awake.* She told herself, trying to deepen her breathing. *It was just a nightmare. Again.* But she let go of her blanket and saw that she was shaking. Cisila slowly wiped her forehead, feeling the cold sweat. Closing her eyes slowly, she took control of her breathing. In, and out. In...and out. *Just a nightmare.* She reminded herself. Cisila breathed in through her nose, and exhaled through her mouth. *Okay.* She thought. Ever since the incident aboard the *Silver Pike,* Cisila had had recurring nightmares. The first night it happened, back on the *Platinum Halberd,* was still clear in her memory. Her scream as she had woken up that night also made everybody in her dorm jump. Being on the ship hadn't helped, either. All she could see in the corridors of the *Halberd* was blood, guts and death. Even if it wasn't the victim of the worms' parasitic infection, the corridors of the *Pike* were identical to the *Halberd.* Cisila begged to be let go from the engineer team, as she was physically unable to work. Emdara had obliged this, and called for a transport. Now, she was back home in Amadnésam after only a little over a week since the incident, which had since been internally called by Carbine the *Silver Pike Massacre*. The ship was now under for refits and repairs, and was currently out of service. The *Halberd* had to work double time to cover the research that the Pike was going to miss while it was out. Slowly, Cisila slid out of her bed and walked over to the window, and stared out at Amadnésam. Her breathing may have stabilised, but it still felt shaky. Amadnésam was bright. Shiny. Every skyscraper glinted in the early morning light. Cisila pulled a towel off of her desk and dried her face off slowly. Putting it down after she felt better, Cisila walked back over to her bed and unplugged her phone from its charger. Picking it up, she hesitated. Amélia, one of the *Halberd's* crew members that boarded the *Pike* with Cisila, wanted Cisila to call her if she continued to have nightmares. But it was early in the morning, and she was unsure if the *Halberd* even had a stable enough connection for calls to go through. *"I don't care when you call me- just, please, call me. I don't want you to just disappear. We're gonna miss you."* She had said. Cisila sighed, and relented, calling Amé.
