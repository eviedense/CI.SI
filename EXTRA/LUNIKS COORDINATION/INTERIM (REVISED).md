*"This is a serious violation of P.E policies. You've got one job: Kill him."* \
That was it. That was all Martin had told her. And for all intents and purposes, it was the only thing she needed to know. There was no reason to understand why. There was no reason not to act when the entire dusty and crumbling city of Chicago was alarmed by the man. *"How?"* She had asked. Martin just stared into her eye, the only eye she still had. *"However necessary."* was his response. Gradient had decided to take that as far as it would go. As she sprinted down an empty street in Chicago, the bright sun blazing down upon her. Splayed across the streets, metal frames of decades old cars lay. Keeping a tight grip on her sheathed blade, attached to her combat belt, Gradient fastened the hooded cloak that only covered her upper chest and arms. The hood was down. Her medium-length tangled mess of brown hair was catching sand particles. Gradient's black metal arms, with a hint of dusty gold, glinted in the sunlight. Her solitary eye was coloured like wine, while the other had been replaced by a boxy metal apparatus. Each step she took down the street, sprinting closer and closer to where the target was believed to be, the sand below her kicked up behind her. *"Target's oscar mike."* A voice suddenly reported directly into her ear. Her radio had sputtered to life and the earpiece in her ear made her eye flinch as she sped up. "Where?" Gradient asked blankly, watching the street ahead of her. There was an intersection coming up, where garbage and ruins lay. One turn was completely blocked by a collapsed building. *"East."* The voice reported. Kellien, her brand-new squadmate. The connection sputtered a bit as Kellien continued on, the audio crackling. *"It looks like he's heading towards gang territory. Smart."* Kellien remarked. East was straight ahead, Gradient remembered. Her eye narrowed and she sped up, kicking plumes of sand into the air harder. "He's not going to get there." Gradient replied, emotionless. *"He's way ahead of you. He got the head start a couple of hours ago."* Kellien muttered. *"I don't know if you can catch him. Palmer's sending you in because nobody else could get to him, so I guess you must have some kind of merit."* Gradient rolled her eye and continued to sprint down the street, watching ahead of her. There seemed to have been a poorly made wall blocking the street further down. Gang territory. Where the target was going. *"Ah, shit."* Kellien hissed, and through the poor transmission of the radio, she heard the distinct *clicking* of Kellien adjusting his sniper rifle. *"I just lost him. He went into gang territory, and immediately dropped into the sewers. If we're not careful, he's going to get into the Underground."* The Underground was PALMER-EDEN's proudest achievement. An entire sustainable city underneath a dying one, stretching for miles. If their target got back down, they would never be able to find him. And that meant Martin Palmer would be disappointed. Gradient could *not* afford for that to happen, not since the last time it happened. \
"The sewer systems?" Gradient repeated, looking down at the street. "I might be able to avoid the gang territory, if that's the case..." and with that, Gradient kicked her heel into the road and slowly slid to a stop, her boots scraping against the cracking tarmac. She had stopped just near a manhole, and without a second thought, Gradient rushed over to it and pried it open with her metal hands, lifting it of its place and dropped it on the road. It landed with a *thunk*, sending some sand into the air, and wobbled for a moment before settling to a stop. "Going down. You're about to lose visual." Gradient reported before dropping down into the manhole, the ancient ladder creaking as she slid down it. It would probably easily break if she put enough force on it. \
Landing in the sewer, she was mildly surprised to feel her feet touch water. The surface sewage had been rerouted to the underground, and now these specific tunnels had no purpose. Usually, they were used for gangs, or in this case, runaways. The tunnel was large, and most sounds bounced off of the walls dozens of times before fading away. Gradient twisted a dial on her radio, and reported, "Tunnel's dark. Pulling out the NVGs." And she pulled a set of bulky night vision goggles off of her toolbelt and pulled them over her head, fastening the straps. She flicked on the device and the goggles flared to life with a high-pitched *whirr,* which continued getting higher and higher until it faded out. As the goggles turned on, she was blinded for a moment by them before they adjusted to the light around them with their distinct green colours. *"Keep moving. Sierra's caught a glimpse of him through SATNAV. He's...he's heading back?"* Kellien reported, sounding mildly confused. *"He's heading directly to your position. I- I don't...just- just get him. I don't know what he's doing."* Gradient let go of her sheathed blade and instead pulled her large, bulky pistol out of its holster. Racking the slide and letting it snap forward, Gradient raised it and began to walk forward, the sights of the pistol trained down the tunnel, watching for the man. Her footsteps in the water echoed off the walls. After what felt like a few minutes of carefully walking forward, Gradient saw nothing. "There's nobody here..." She said, blankly, her voice bouncing off the circular tunnel. *"What?"* Kellien said, even more confused. *"I- he- Sierra, what the hell's going on?"* He said, presumably turning to Gradient's other squadmate: Sierra. *"I don't know."* She responded, sounding exasperated. *"He should've just passed Gradient now. I know this isn't the SATNAV's best use, but it hasn't just- given us a wrong tracking before. Is there really nobody there?!"* Gradient looked up, expecting to see something on the ceiling. And then she turned around. Through the green night vision, she saw nothing. Just the dark, grimy sewer tunnel that she had already been wading through. "No. There's...there's nobody." Gradient muttered. And for the first time in a while, she felt an emotion. Confusion. *"Shit."* Kellien sputtered. *"Shit- I don't know what they did, but I think it was a misdirect. We can't track him anymore. Gradient, he's got to be in the sewers still. Keep moving forward, and...and just- get him. Palmer says that data is extremely sensitive."* He sounded more and more panicked with every word. Gradient immediately holstered her pistol and broke into a sprint, pushing her legs as hard as they would let her. Without a signal to track, Gradient would have to try every turn. Every crevice. *Anything* to find this man. As she continued, she turned around a bend and saw light flooding in, peaking the NVG's sensors and blanking out their lenses. This had to be where he had gone. Gradient rushed towards the opening and lifted the goggles off of her head, fastening them onto her toolbelt. Sunlight spilled into the tunnel from the open manhole above her, and just as she grabbed hold of the ladder and began to climb up, the distinct noise of thick metal scraping against tarmac filled her ears. "What the..." She hissed, staring up. Someone shoved the manhole cover back into place and it landed with a *thunk.* \
"Kellien, the-" Gradient began to say, but she suddenly felt the barrel of a pistol touch the back of her head. Immediately, she closed her mouth and let go of the ladder. Her expression went blank, emotionless. "Stop chasing him." The person behind her said calmly. "You don't know what's in those SSDs he stole, do you?" They asked. "Or those datacards." Gradient didn't respond, and slowly lowered her arms to her sides, her left slowly grasping the sheathe of her blade. But it seemed the mystery person noticed, and pushed the barrel harder against the back of her head. "*Don't* try anything." They hissed. "I want to ask you a question before I leave. But you have to confirm whether or not you'll stop chasing him." They continued, the barrel straying from the back of her head. "*What* do you want?" Gradient snapped, turning her head to look back. The figure behind her, strangely, was wearing a rather nice suit that was in all black. Their dress shoes were submerged in the shallow sewer water, but it didn't seem like they cared. They had sleek, black gloves on, and the pistol they were using looked to be surprisingly bright and silver, as opposed to the rest of their outfit. Their black hair wrapped around their neck and strayed outwards. And even more strangely, they were wearing *sunglasses.* Who the hell wore sunglasses in the dark? In addition to this, Gradient could see how pale they were, despite the shadows and inky black pressing in on them. Frowning, she waited for an answer. "Answer me first." The person repeated. Gradient immediately snapped back, "I have no *reason* not to continue my chase. My entire life would be a waste if I just said, 'Well, guess I'll stop'!" The mysterious figure tilted their head to the side and sighed, pushing their sunglasses further up the bridge of their nose. "You don't *have* a life." They muttered, lowering the pistol. "But I see how it is. You're refusing to give up the pursuit for the sake of PALMER-EDEN." They took a step back and slid the pistol back into their suit's jacket. Gradient turned around and wrapped her hand around the grip of her blade, and began to unsheathe it. *What* did they mean she didn't have a life? Her life *was* PALMER-EDEN. Her entire life had been to protect and serve. Despite Gradient's threatening blade, the suited figure remained seemingly calm. "I'll just tell you two things." They said, pulling something else out from their suit. It looked like a small card of cardstock. "One." They began, holding the card out. "Hammerhead is seeking you out." Gradient looked down at the card, and realized what it was. A *business* card? There was writing on it that she couldn't quite make out, and she impulsively sheathed her blade and reached for it. "Two..." The figure continued, letting Gradient take the card. They slowly lowered their arm. "Your life, as you know it, is an extreme manipulation and abuse of who you were." They took a few more steps back. \
"...What?" Gradient sputtered, looking up from the business card.

But the mysterious suited figure was gone. And Gradient couldn't quite tell if they were a man or a woman.

*"...Gradient, what the fuck was that?"* Kellien asked, after a brief moment of silence. "I...I don't know." Gradient replied, staring at the business card in her hand. Who in this day and age, in this ruined city...used a business card? What on *Earth* was Hammerhead? Was this all some kind of sick joke? To get her to pause her pursuit? "I..." She felt her stomach twist, unsure of what to say next. Looking up at where the suited person had been, she felt herself frown, and her brow furrowed. For the first time in her life, Gradient was conflicted. A part of her wanted to know what was in those SSDs, and the datacards that the man had stolen. That same part of her needed to know what the figure had meant by saying that she didn't have a life. That her life was a "manipulation" of what she once was? She had never been anybody else. That was ridiculous. Had they been trying to imply that she had lost her memories, or some other sort of thing? It was false, and she was aware of it. Gradient remembered her upbringing. Her parents. It was all real, and what the suited figure was saying was lies. Manipulation. "It's nothing. Where did the target go?" She finally said, after deliberating on it. Shoving the card into a pouch, Gradient almost immediately forgot it was there, and turned back to the mission. *"He's back on the street. I couldn't get a shot in, but I saw him close a manhole."* Gradient hopped back onto the ladder and began pulling herself up to the cover. Each step she advanced was followed by clanging as her boots hit the metal of the ladder. Heaving herself to the top, Gradient shoved the manhole cover off of the opening and climbed up, back out onto the street. And immediately...she saw the target sprinting down the street. "Got a visual." She hissed, and immediately took off, sending a plume of sand up as she rocketed forwards. Gradient immediately become laser focused on catching the man, on tearing him apart. She was focused on what she had to do. This man had committed a crime. This man would *die* for stealing such important data from PALMER-EDEN.
