### -[The CSEP *Platinum Halberd*, Space {Standard Route Between Dvóniks and Lóivonus}]-
### -[Cisila J. Siveta, 26]-

Sparks of metal flew as Cisila put the welding torch against a metal plate, forcing it back into place with her free hand. It was a stupid solution, she thought to herself, but there was only so much gear on the ship. The torch sparked as it met the metal plate, and she begin to move the end of the torch along the plate's end, welding it into the other plates. It had blown off a couple of days ago, and nobody had been around to fix it. The sparking torch lit up the lower hull as Cisila brought it along the snapped plating, illuminating the various pipes, wires, and power cells. After she finished with the plate, Cisila got up and turned the welding torch off, flicking a switch on the grip with a small *click.* She shoved the welding torch into her harness, and strapped it in. Sighing, Cisila turned around and looked at the energy array of the *Halberd,* which powered most of the main systems. It was a metal casing which covered large energy cells filled with an ionic liquid that sent energy to the ship's data arrays, main computers, aswell as the ship's command bridge. The portion that Cisila could see looked small, even though she knew how big the energy cells really were, embedded into the hull. Yawning, Cisila pulled up the Hammerhead welding mask she'd been using, and rubbed her eyes. It was impossible to tell time properly in space, other than the coordinated timezones in space. Ever since boarding the *Platinum Halberd,* Cisila's sleep schedule had been messed up beyond belief. It was wake up, work, sleep. Wake up, work, sleep. All the windows showed the same starry emptiness as they usually did, occasionally revealing a planet in the distance. The ship, for the most part, floated freely in space, its engines off. But down in the lower hull, where most of the mechanical functions happened, Cisila could hear the warbling and consistent beating of the engine's systems. The main power source, a large reactor, hummed. The warbling came from the air-con systems, cycling air in and out of the ship and re-cooling it every minute. *All the same.*  Cisila thought, looking around. The plating had come off from the air-con systems, and the rest of the hull looked just like it. Metal plating. The cables coming down from the ceiling. An odd feeling of claustrophobia. The entire ship had that feeling, but down here...it felt especially cramped. Turning away from the systems, Cisila carefully made her way over to a ladder, illuminated by a dim, orange light, and she grabbed onto it. She was going to head straight back up to the main deck, to check how weapon development was going. The entire crew (consisting of about sixty to sixty-five people, she remembered) was assigned a lot of tasks each week, and this week, Cisila had to keep an eye on weapon development, one of the ship's main experiments. 

It would orbit the planet *Lúniks* occasionally, and transfer most of its data and finished work to teams down on the planet. Drug research, weapon development, specimen research, and combat training were the primary focuses of the ship. It had decently sized laboratories, firing ranges, and a gym. Singular. Most of the rooms were "decently sized" for the ship, as most were only accessible through cramped ladder climbs like the one Cisila was climbing up with. As she climbed up, her gear clanked and thunked against the metal tubing around her. Her harness was quite heavy on its own, with all of her engineer tools strapped to it. She was wearing a simple t-shirt and vest which the harness went over, aswell as large cargo pants fitted for extreme conditions. Connected to her harness was a toolbelt wrapping around her waist, holding several pieces of tech that could help her identify and solve problems with the ship. Along with her normal welding torch, strapped to the opposite side of her harness, was a plasma welder. It was used for more heavy duty work like the energy cells, of which it couldn't damage, while the normal welding torch - using pretty old technology - would likely cause the cells to burst, sending the ionic liquid everywhere. Pulling herself up the ladder and onto *D-Deck,* Cisila pulled off her welding faceshield and folded it up in her hands, shoving it into one of her toolbelt's many pouches. Looking down the hallway she'd ended up in, Cisila already knew where she was- the upper maintenance facilities, where most of the engineers hung out during the work hours. It was also where the giant and bulky repair suits sat when they weren't used, near the airlock at the end of the repair bay. Cisila tugged on the thing strapped to her forearm, a slim device that resembled a large phone from decades ago. It was Carbine's proprietary engineer info pad, assigned to every engineer on the ship. It could easily access the ship's systems, datalogs, and could communicate with other devices. But on Cisila's arm, it was *extremely* uncomfortable. She lifted her arm up so she could have a look at the screen, and as she did, it blipped to life. Its simple operating system immediately displayed what Cisila needed to see, and nothing else. First of all, a log of every repair done in the day. Hers was the only one listed, and was listed as *Plate repair - Engine level*. She put a finger to the screen and swiped right, bringing up a diagram of the ship. The screen shone brightly as it proudly displayed the *Halberd,* in all of its apparent glory. Only displaying one colour - a blinding golden yellow - Cisila looked at the ship for any other damages. As she was looking, her eyes scanning the screen, something beeped. She jumped. *Fuck!* Cisila thought, looking up, shaking her head. *That was my-* Before she could put together another coherent thought, a notification appeared on her screen. A call. She pressed the *Accept* prompt and flicked a switch on the side of the device, unmuting herself. "Cisila." A voice said. "Captain needs you to take care of something, since you're the closest to the repair bay on D-Deck." They said. "One of the starboard engines is flickering, and if it goes out, our drifting will go off course and it'll take a while to readjust. See if you can repair it." Cisila pursed her lips, before responding. "Yeah. Alright." She said. The person on the other end was Kellien, chief of security on the ship. She was usually the one to relay messages from the captain, Mr. Emdara, to Cisila. "Tell him it might take thirty or so minutes." She added, heading down the hallway to the repair bay. Her boots thunked against the metal of the floor. "I hate dealing with those engines." Cisila muttered as Kellien disconnected.

As Cisila climbed through the door into the repair bay, she saw the giant suits of metal sitting at the back end of the room, near the airlock. They were Hammerhead Heavy-Duty Exoskeleton And Titan Heart [HDEATH] repair suits, fitted for extreme space conditions. The "Titan Heart" part of the name referred to the odd power system and structure of the suit's exoskeleton, where pressure was maintained in the limbs with ionic liquids similar to the energy cells of the *Halberd* through an artificial "heart" in the back of the suit. Other than the exoskeleton, machined metal plating covered the armor, reminiscent of heavy duty power armor suits. But instead of weapons, the HDEATH suits were fitted with repair tools, such as a beefier version of Cisila's plasma welder, along with an array of different saws, claws, and other tools that were interchangeable. Cisila approached one slowly, and even despite it being turned away from her, it still towered over her. The handles to open up the back of the suit were large, and they were locked into place by safety latches. As she began to pull the safety latches, letting them click apart, another voice appeared in her ear, just like Kellien's. "How's the work going?" A familiar voice said. One of her engineer friends, probably up on a higher deck- Amélia, or just Amé. "S'good." Cisila responded, continuing to pull the safety latches off. "Getting into an aech-death, though." She added, blankly. "*Fuck.*" Amé said, hissing. "I hate those things." The HDEATH platform of suits were extremely useful, but the odd Titan Heart concept made everyone oddly uncomfortable. "Goddamned beating hearts..." Amé muttered. "What are you even doing, anyways?" She asked. "One of the starboard engines is out." Cisila explained, "I'm closest to it." She was on D-Deck's starboard side in the repair bay, which was one of two. The identical, but opposite one, was on the port side of D-Deck. "Oh, great." Amé muttered. "I *love* engine maintenance. Have fun." And with a click, Amé disconnected, going back to whatever she was doing. Cisila yanked the suit's handles back, and they clunked into place, freeing up the back of the suit. She pulled the back down, and, with a *hiss* from the suit's hydraulics, the entire back of the suits' legs came down aswell, letting Cisila climb in easily. She would still have to fit her head into the giant helmet, and position her arms in the sockets, too. 

Pulling herself into the suit, her feet pressed down on the pressure sensitive pads inside the suit's feet, and as they did, the back of the legs and suit lifted back up and sealed Cisila inside as she slid her arms through the sockets and into the suit's arms. As she settled herself in and let the suit turn on, she felt the suit whirr. The lenses of the helmet came to life, the HUD briefly blinding her as it adjusted itself to the lighting conditions. As the suit activated, she felt the heart in the back plating begin to beat. *Thunk. Thunk. Thunk.* It started fast, and hard, before slowing down and becoming less noticeable. As it beat, the arms, legs, and every joint of the armor came to life, letting Cisila move in the suit. Her arms dropped to her side smoothly, and she felt herself able to move her legs. She stepped backwards, and feeling the clunk of the heavy metal feet, Cisila oriented herself and stomped over to the airlock, reaching up to the ceiling and grabbing the handles to open the airlock with the HDEATH suit. Twisting the set of handles clockwise on one side, and counter-clockwise with the other to have them both oriented horizontally, Cisila thunked them into place and let go, stomping into the airlock before the door closed. As she got into the airlock, the doors snapped shut behind her and she felt all the air disappear, sucked back into the ship. Cisila rolled her head side to side, stretching her neck, waiting for the second set of doors to snap open and let her out onto the ship. The HDEATH system was fitted with repulsors and magnets, letting Cisila safely and easily scale and float to the starboard engine in need of repair. Suddenly, the doors snapped open, the heavy metal flying out of her way as the vacuum opened up into the room. Activating the magnets in the soles of the HDEATH suit, Cisila trudged slowly, tugging her feet up as if sticky gum was stuck to them. Each step towards the edge of the open room was excruciating. The endless void of space, filled with stars, awaited her. As she left the airlock, Cisila activated the repulsors on the back of the suit, aswell as the soles' pair of repulsors, and she oriented herself so both would propel her towards the rear of the ship, straight for the starboard engines. The ship was largely angular, metal panels and cables running along it. It was a precisely built craft, but a lot of its space seemed to go unused, stretching for far more distance than the standard decks took up. But, for all intents and purposes, the *Platinum Halberd* was the perfect research ship for Carbine. It had everything the crew needed, and as Cisila drifted along it, ascending up the side of it, she could see why Carbine paraded it around. It looked nice from the outside. But everything else...was a complete and utter mess. The interior was barely holding together, and the engineers - including herself - had to work around the clock to keep the ship functional. But for a moment...Cisila forgot her worries. She drifted along the ship in the HDEATH suit, admiring it. Admiring space. The endless nothingness may have been terrifying to some, but to her, the lack of noise was calming.

<sup><sub>Note: Cue in Under Cover from Halo Infinite</sub></sup>

In some of the windows, she could see crew members heading from one end of a deck to another, shunting supplies or test weapons into the frigate's various experimental areas and firing ranges. Some crew members were in modified HDEATH suits and were on the exterior of the ship, testing weapons in a vacuum. As she glided through the empty vastness of space towards the starboard engines, she waved at a pair of crew members testing what looked like a gauss cannon. They waved back. After a few short minutes of suspended gliding, Cisila pulled a grappling hook off of the HDEATH's toolbelt, and fired it into the ship, reeling herself in. She was close enough to magnetically walk towards the engine and start repairs. When she landed with a rough *thunk,* Cisila twisted a knob on the chest of the suit, turning on its radio. Immediately, it connected her to Kellien. "Almost at the starboard engines. Which one is it?" She asked. Kellien sighed, before checking. "Uppermost one. The engine itself should be flickering. Damage is...mostly external. Might've gotten hit." She rattled off. Kellien was obviously just reading off the damage report, but Cisila wasn't able to access it herself while in the HDEATH suit. "Thanks." Cisila muttered, finally jumping down onto the uppermost starboard engine. The engines were large, with bright, hot energy coming out of the exhausts. They were round with expertly crafted internals, making repairs from the outside rather easy. But right now, she just had to find whatever may have 'hit' the ship. In the HDEATH suit with its magnetic footholds on, Cisila stomped her way along the engine, scanning it from the helmet. She spotted a large dent that broke straight through the metal encasing of the engine, and quickly made her way towards it. "Got it." Cisila said. "Looks like some debris hit it, that's all." She could easily fix the damage with the large plasma welder connected to the suit. Cisila trudged over to the damage and kneeled down in the suit, pulling the plasma welder off of its magnetic holster. She turned it on, and it bursted to life, plasma globs dropping from the end of the welder. She peered into the damage, trying to see what caused it. An asteroid was lodged inside the engine, but it seemed to have stopped dead before hitting anything vital to the engine. Cisila lifted her free hand up and reversed the repulsor on the palm of the hand, pulling the asteroid out of the engine. She grabbed hold of it and noticed something...odd about it. It was glowing. Cracks permeated the surface, glowing a strange blue. *Odd.* Her mind echoed. She decided to strap it to the HDEATH suit, and bring it to the labs later. For now, she had to weld the damage back together and make sure everything was functional. First, she started with any interior damage she could find. Wires needed to be re-attached, and certain engine parts were broken. Welding the parts back together and re-fastening the wires, Cisila welded the exterior damage shut after a few minutes. "Repair complete." Cisila muttered, standing up. "Can confirm that it was an asteroid, but it looks weird. I'm bringing it in." She said. "Okay..." Kellien muttered. "You think it's worth a look?" she asked. Cisila thought so. Anything that glowed had *something* up with it. "Yeah." Cisila said. "Again- bringing it in. I'm done with the repair." 

-

Pulling herself out of the HDEATH suit carefully, Cisila pulled the asteroid piece off of it, shoving it under her arm. She was going to head up to B-deck with the asteroid, and give it to one of the researchers. Personally, while it *did* seem strange, Cisila wasn't entirely sure if it was truly anything special. Stepping out of the repair bay and back into the starboard D-deck hall, Cisila took a left turn to head for the central staircase. The staircase went to every deck, except for A-deck, where you needed special access. A *lot* of space was reserved for A-deck, even if the majority of the ship was B through D-decks, and due to this, every other deck felt cramped under the weight of what A-deck had. As Cisila entered the staircase and headed up to B-deck, she looked around. The staircase was generally brighter (and a little cleaner) than the maintenance hallways, but still seemed like it needed constant repair work. Climbing up the metal staircase, she passed a couple other crew members, who waved at her. They were too busy to say anything, either carrying experimental weapons or doing repairs on the staircase. She nodded back at them, and after a minute of climbing up, Cisila entered B-deck, portside. Immediately, the environment changed. The laboratories were pristine, and brighter than the rest of the ship. Amazingly bright white walls lined the hallways and the doors were trimmed in black to stand out, and she made her way towards one of the furthest lab rooms, Lab 2M. Portside labs were labelled '2', while starboard was '1'. Heading in, the door thunked open and slammed shut behind her rather aggressively, and she was greeted by a researcher. "Hey." They said, getting up from their seat at a testing bench. "What's up?" 

Cisila held up the asteroid, and the researcher stared at it. The first thing Cisila noticed about the girl was her stunning bright pink hair, which melted into black at the roots. Her face was thin, but not gaunt. She didn't look tired, unlike Cisila. "...Space rock." Cisila mumbled, a little stupidly. "Gah-" She shook her head. "Sorry." The girl snorted, and crossed her arms. "Space rock. Go on." She said, smiling. Cisila sighed, and actually put words together properly. "Hit the uppermost starboard engine. Not sure what it is, but it glows." She said, holding it up. The girl pursed her lips and stared at it for a moment. "...Can I have a look at it?" She asked. Cisila nodded, and held it out to her. "Oh, *cool*." The girl muttered, snatching the large asteroid. It glowed in her hands. "Name's Steph, by the way." She said to Cisila. "Don't think we've met. You're on the engineer team?" Steph added. Cisila nodded again, crossing her arms. "I've never gotten to use one of those suits. Whaddya call 'em..." Steph muttered, heading over to her research bench. She ripped a chunk of the asteroid out with such surprising strength that it made Cisila do a double take. She sputtered a response to Stepth, "Uh- aech-death. They're called aech-death suits." Steph looked back and nodded, "Yeaaah- those things. Dunno why everybody's so scared of them..." she muttered, beginning to test the chunk of rock she took. Cisila couldn't make heads or tails of what Steph was doing, but all she needed to know was that she was doing something. As Steph messed with the rock, Cisila walked up to one of the many large windows in the lab, staring out at space. Silence ensued. The only noises permeating the lab were Steph, who was trying to figure out a way to scan the asteroid. As Cisila watched the static outside, littered with stars, her mind drifted. When she was deep in thought, suddenly, the entire ship *thunked.* It rocked from one side to the other, sending Cisila one way and to the other, and Steph nearly got her foot crushed by the asteroid as it skidded off the research bench. "What the FUCK!?" Cisila yelled, catching herself on one of the research benches. The ship returned to its normal stability, letting Steph and Cisila take a breath. "Fuck..." Steph wheezed, shaking her head. "What the *hell* was that...?!" Before Cisila could try and answer, the shipwide announcement system blared to life with a set of beeps, making a chime. The voice that the both of them heard was of the captain, Emdara. The microphone for the system was blown out, and was barely used for that matter. If Emdara was using it, it had to be for a bad reason. "It- it looks like we've been..." Emdara struggled to explain. "Y'know-" He dropped his professional voice, "I'm not sure what happened. We've gone completely off course." *What?* Cisila thought, brow furrowing. Steph looked just as concerned. "...Our maps are freaking out." He said.

"Our navigation systems are still operational, but they say we're..." Emdara sighed. "They say we're- in the middle of nowhere. We're off the route." Cisila felt her heart drop. That was the worst possible thing that could happen. If the *Halberd* had gone off course, they couldn't ensure everybody's safety. And even worse, if they were in the middle of nowhere, then that meant there were no routes near them. It sounded as if they were in deep space. "Now, I know that *sounds* bad, but I've heard of this happening before." Emdara continued, "The ship should be equipped with a way to get us back on route in the event of something like this. It just...requires a lot of work." He muttered. "In the mean time, we-" He stopped. Something had made him pause. "...The *fuck?*" He hissed over the system. "Shit," Steph muttered, "This is *bad.*" *No fucking shit!* Cisila's mind echoed. She quickly got back to the window and peered out of it, having spotted something blocking out the stars. "What...the hell?" She whispered. Steph rushed up next to her to look at it aswell. The two stared at the massive hulk of inky blackness, blocking out the stars. "There's a ship." Emdara said. "That's another *ship.*" He repeated, exasperated. "That's- I-" He appeared to be in disbelief, before he suddenly shut off the announcement system. "Fucking hell..." Cisila hissed. "A ship...?!" Steph muttered. "Aren't we in the middle of nowhere? What's-" But Steph stopped as she realized something. None of the ships' lights were on. It was drifting in space, dead. Ominously blocking the twinkling stars. It was a similar size to the *Halberd,* and looked like it was also built by Carbine- at least from the silhouette that Cisila could see. What could it be? How did it get here? Something in Cisila twinged, before she realized. "Wait-" She whispered, feeling numb. *Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.* She put a hand on the window, trying to get a better look at the ship. Steph stared in silence, confused. "...What is it?" Steph asked. Cisila felt herself become incredibly uneasy. "I recognize that silhouette." She hesitated. 

"...Wait..." Steph muttered. The two of them stared at the silhouette of the ship.

"It's the *Silver Pike.*" Cisila dejectedly whispered.

The *Platinum Halberd's* sister ship. It was floating in deep space. Completely dead.

*How* had it gotten here? How had *they* gotten here? And worse...what had happened to it?

"Kellien!" Cisila said, calling up Kellien from her forearm mounted data device. "Kellien, that's the fucking *Silver Pike!*" She turned away from the window quickly, trying not to look at it. "Yeah, I fucking know." Kellien said, sounding stressed. "Everybody up on A-deck is freaking the *fuck* out." Cisila felt herself beginning to freak out, but she tried to push it down. "Okay. Okay." Cisila breathed. "WHY is it here?!" She screeched, feeling herself shaking. "*Where* are we?!" She couldn't stop the questions. "STOP!" Kellien screamed, the mic clipping and piercing Cisila's ears. "Ow- *fuck.* Sorry." She mumbled. "No, sorry-" Kellien sputtered. "Everybody's panicking up here. We need to find out what's going on there." She tried to explain, calming down. "You're portside, right? You saw the ship?" She asked. "Yes." Cisila said. Kellien paused. "...You wouldn't mind volunteering to take a look on the ship, would you?" Kellien asked. Cisila considered this for a moment. On one hand...something bad looked like it had happened, and it was strange to see the *Silver Pike* so close to them. Unnaturally so. On the other hand, the crew was definitely still alive, and the *Halberd* needed the *Pike* in order to maintain the space route and to consistently trade data. Even if the ship needed repairs, Cisila had done worse. It wouldn't hurt to head in, would it? "...Y'know what..." Cisila said, "Sure. I'll go." Kellien sighed, "Thank God. Emdara was going to bug a bunch of the engineers. Now he doesn't have to. Can you head to the A-deck access hatch on the portside? I'll give you access to come up and we'll get your little squad assembled." Kellien rattled off. "Alright." Cisila sighed, disconnecting from Kellien. She headed for the door, while Steph continued to stare out the window at the *Pike.* "...See you later." Cisila said, leaving Lab 2M. She headed straight for the A-deck access hatch, her boots clunking against the metal floors. There was nobody in the hallways, but it still felt as though panic had seeped in from every crack of the ship. Climbing up a small set of stairs at the end of the hall, she grabbed hold of the A-deck access hatch handle, tugging it open. Usually, it wouldn't budge, but for Cisila, the lever *thunked* upwards and the hatch opened, giving her access to the ladder. Slowly, and carefully, she climbed up the ladder, and made her way up onto A-deck.

A few minutes later, Kellien had gotten her set up near the boarding hatch. The *Halberd* had to position itself so it could connect with the *Pike* via a large tube system, letting crew travel from one end to the other. It was proprietary to the two ships, and if the ship hadn't been the *Pike,* they likely would not have been able to get in without the use of their HDEATH suits. Cisila had all of her repair gear ready to go for any interior repairs, and had been given a set of state-of-the-art nightvision goggles. They were sleek, slim, and fit her face well, covering her eyes and letting her see perfectly in the dark. She also had a flashlight, in case the nightvision goggles didn't work. Cisila was joined by a couple other engineers. Derrick, who looked constantly tired and didn't bother to shave himself, and to her surprise, Amé. Amé was dressed in her usual engineer gear, similar to Cisila's, and her hair was tied back into a tight ponytail. However, her hair was still a mess. "Yo." Amé said, slapping her hand on Cisila's shoulder. "You ready?" She asked. "...I hope so." Cisila muttered, getting up. In addition to the engineers, Steph had also shown up. She was equipped with a lot of research gear in case anything bad had happened to ship- she would be able to extract the ship's datalogs to find out what happened. "Alright." Kellien said, stepping towards the boarding hatch. "Remember- this isn't that big of a deal. I'm sure the crew's fine. Just get in and help out with whatever they need." She explained. The ship jostled as the tubing system connected with the *Pike*, and the hydraulics around the hatch hissed with air, indicating that the seal was as good as it would get. "Perfect." Kellien muttered, pulling the hatch open. Cisila looked at Amé, Derrick, and then Steph. Derrick stepped forward first, putting his plasma welder in its holster. "Hope they're all good in there..." Derrick mumbled, and he was the first to step into the boarding tube. Cisila, Amé, and Steph followed. Kellien watched them go, and left the boarding hatch open. There was no need to close it. As the four walked down the boarding tube, it wobbled ominously. This was normal, but it always made Cisila nervous whenever she had to cross one. "I can't see any readings from the ship's engines. They might be down." Amé said, checking her forearm mounted data device. "Most of the power cells are dead, too." Derrick said, checking his own. "Oxygen systems are still online, aswell as air-con, though." He added. "If they're alive, they're good. Just sitting in the dark." Cisila got to the *Silver Pike's* boarding hatch first, and grabbed hold of the valve that opened it. Turning it, she felt the weight of it. It was extremely heavy and her hands would slip occasionally as she turned it. It creaked every so often, but after about ten seconds of turning it, the hatch opened with a hiss. Pushing it open with her foot, the hatch swung open, revealing an identical main A-deck area to the *Halberd.* The boarding tube's lights flooded into the room, which was otherwise pitch black. The four stepped down into the A-deck, looking around. Cisila pulled her NVGs down, and with a high-pitched whirr, they came to life. And almost as soon as they did, Cisila saw that things were incredibly wrong.

The other three gasped. The boarding tube's lights didn't stretch far enough to show any of it to the naked eye, but the walls and windows...were covered in blood. Guts were strewn about on the floor. Limbs, too. It hadn't even been ten seconds, and it had already gone off the deep end. "Oh *fuck.*" Amé said. "Oh, you're *fucking* joking." She hissed. Derrick stared silently, as did Steph. Cisila felt numb. "No, no, *hell* no." Amé whispered, backing up. "Absolutely *fucking* not." Her heel thunked against the boarding hatch's door frame and she almost fell over. She caught herself on the hatch and pulled herself back up, ducking out of the way of the hatch as it...began to close. Amé got out of the way, but...the hatch glided back into its place, *thunked*, and sealed with a hiss. Amé paused. She looked at the hatch, and then at the group. And then back. She bit her lip nervously. "...Does...does it open from this side?" Steph whispered. Amé grabbed hold of the hatch's levers and pulled on them. They didn't budge. "Fuck." Amé hissed. Cisila pulled up her data device on her forearm and called Kellien. "Kellien, we just locked ourselves in. And something's...something's really wrong here." She said. "Fucking hell...I saw Amé shut the door." Kellien said. "You *should* be able to open it from that side. You can't?" Amé tried harder to open the hatch. "No dice." Cisila said. "Can you try from your end?" She asked. There was a pause, and they could hear footsteps from the other end of the hatch. The hatch shuddered as Kellien tried to turn the valve on the other side, "Fuck," Kellien grunted, "It won't- *budge*-" she grumbled. Letting go, Kellien sighed. "I can't open it." she said, dejectedly. "You're stuck. Maybe you could try and find your way down to the maintenance level? Turning on the power might do something- the hatch probably opened because we connected to it." Cisila shut her eyes. *Stuck.* Her mind echoed. *Stuck.* At least she wasn't alone. She looked at Steph, Derrick, and then Amé. "...Sorry." Amé mumbled. Everybody stared at her for a moment, in disbelief. "It's fine." Derrick grumbled, pinching the bridge of hise nose and sighing. "We need to find someone, at least. Let's head for main deck access." He began to walk, his boots almost immediately coming into contact with the blood on the floor. There was nothing to be done about it, but Cisila still hated walking in it. Nonetheless, she followed Derrick, and the other two followed, making up the rear. As they were walking, an overhead light near the end of the hallway flickered, sparking. "Ugh-" Derrick grumbled, "Their lights are all effed." He noted. That would require more repairs...but Cisila was beginning to feel like there was no reason to repair the *Pike.* Derrick continued to walk, heading down the hallway. But one of the steps he took...crunched something underneath his foot. Immediately, Derrick froze, and looked down. "Oh. FUCK." He yelled, stumbling back. Cisila tried to get a look, and her eyes went wide. A mangled corpse with only an arm was lying on the floor, and the arm was what Derrick had stepped on. "Wait-" Amé said, staring down at the end of the hallway. "Something's moving down there." Cisila felt her heartrate spike, and as she looked up from the mangled corpse, she saw that there *was* something at the end of the hallway, underneath the flickering and sparking light. It was clearly human (she thought) but it was convulsing irregularly. "It wasn't moving before." Steph pointed out. "It's...it's..." everybody was frozen, staring at it. Odd crunches and squelching noises permeated the air, in the otherwise silent hallway. Uneven, unnatural breathing came from the general direction of the convulsing thing.

"...Hang on..." Steph realized. Leaning against the wall, it looked like she was beginning to lose control of herself. Her voice was shaky. "We- *we don't have any fucking weapons."* She whispered. "Oh. *Fuck.*" Cisila hissed. The group's eyes were locked onto the convulsing corpse, as the breathing and the noises became more irregular, uneven, and less human. "...Is it gonna move, or..." Derrick muttered. Cisila watched the convulsing silhouette, before she realized something. They didn't have weapons, that was for sure, but they *did* have their engineer gear. The plasma welder had a configuration that blasted out plasma globs. It *was* for less precise jobs, but it definitely could melt human tissue and immobilize someone. "Derrick-" Cisila said, pulling her plasma welder out of its holster on her harness. "Derrick, we can use our welders." The plasma welder itself was in two parts, as it became rather bulky to walk around with. Its current configuration was for precision cutter, but when Cisila flicked a switch and unlocked a trigger lock on the grip, it turned into a makeshift plasma pistol. It was slow, cumbersome, but it was better than nothing. "Shit, you're right!" Derrick gleefully said, pulling his out and doing the same thing. Amé followed aswell, but the three realized Steph had nothing. Amé stepped back and acted as a shield for Steph as Derrick and Cisila slowly walked forward, aiming their plasma welders at the convulsing corpse. It was still a long way down the hallway, but had started to convulse harder. Suddenly, with a horrible *crack*, it froze. Derrick stopped, and so did Cisila, their welders trained on the silhouette. Slowly, unnaturally...it got up. "Fuck..." Derrick hissed, keeping his welder in the thing's general area. "That is *not* a fucking human." It may have been shaped like a human, but it could no longer use its limbs properly. With every step, there was a crunch as the legs moved incorrectly. Its arms twitched. Its head...didn't resemble a human's. It was distorted, odd fleshy things breaking out from the skull. It didn't look like an infection. Something about this didn't feel like some kind of viral outbreak, or at least, Cisila thought so. Her grip on the welder tightened as the corpse slowly limped towards the group down the narrow hallway. It felt as though the walls had closed in around them. As it drew closer, it raised an arm towards them. It stopped for a moment, convulsing, reaching towards them. "Eugh- eugh. Euugh. This isn't real. This. Isn't. Real." Amé whispered, denying the obvious in front of her. The corpse made a noise, and seemed to be...Cisila wasn't sure. *Is it fighting against itself?* Her mind echoed. It was impossible to tell. Then...it spoke. *It spoke.* In a distorted voice, its vocal chords mostly ruined. *"Three...two...seven. Please."* It croaked, before it lunged forward. "MOTHERFUCKER!" Derrick screeched, pulling the trigger on the welder. With a burst, a glob of plasma barreled straight from the end of the welder and hit the corpse's face. The thing screeched as the plasma burned through what remained of the face and melted into the skull. The fleshy extensions in the head convulsed incessantly, almost trying to escape. It looked like cables...something Cisila might be able to cut. Thinking fast, she pulled her utility knife out from her toolbelt and lunged forward, stabbing the knife into the extensions and ripping them apart. Blood went everywhere and nearly coated Cisila before she got out of the way, but the corpse fell to the ground, twitching for a few seconds before it settled.

It was dead. It didn't look as though the plasma globs killed the corpse, but rather, Cisila cutting through the fleshy tubes. They seemed separate from the corpse, almost. Upon closer inspection, crouching down, Cisila noticed that the tubes and other bits of flesh pierced through the skull and went straight for the brain. "Awful." She muttered, getting up. "That was definitely a crew member, too." she sighed. Cisila felt sick. "What did it say?" Amé asked. "Three-two-seven." Derrick whispered. "Three digit code. Standard for codes on the *Halberd* and here." He added. Steph frowned. "Then it's got to be for something..." she said. Cisila leaned against the wall slowly, breathing deeply. She twirled around the welder before shoving it back into its holster, trying to figure out a way to distract herself. Derrick put a hand on her shoulder, "Hey. You alright?" he asked. Silently, Cisila nodded. Internally, she felt absolutely horrible. The smell of blood, guts and flesh had begun to fill her nostrils. She didn't want to go anywhere. "We need to get down to the engines." Derrick said. Again, she nodded, and pulled herself off the wall. "Okay." Cisila mumbled, shaking her head. She couldn't get out of this, and needed to focus. Derrick holstered his plasma welder and clapped his hands together, and spoke. "The access hatch to the rest of the ship should be down this hallway. If one of those things shows up again..." his lip twitched as he paused, "...we're going to have to shoot it." He finished. The group nodded, and they began to walk down the hallway, towards the flickering and sparking light. Blood was smeared along the walls, desperate bids by the *Pike*'s crew to get away from whatever horror they had come across. As they walked, Cisila got another call from Kellien. Connecting to Kellien, Cisila adjusted her goggles. "There's a giant hole on the starboard B-deck of the *Pike*." Kellien cautioned, out of the blue. "The entire deck might be in vacuum, I'm not sure if the heavy doors are sealed." she said. "Fuck." Cisila hissed. "Then a lot of the crew's probably..." She pursed her lips, stopping herself. She knew some of the crew on the *Silver Pike,* and she wouldn't be able to believe they were dead. "Just- just avoid B-deck, unless you get your hands on the ship's aech-death suits." Kellien added. Derrick pulled open the A-deck access hatch and peered in. "Looks fine." He said, as Cisila disconnected from Kellien. Amé stared down it, wary. Cisila sidled past Derrick and climbed down it first. "Hey?" Derrick said, as Cisila began to lower herself down. "There's a big hole in B-deck's starboard side." She said, looking up. "I'd just like to check if portside is sealed off or not. If it isn't, we're fucked." Derrick stared down at her, seemingly in disbelief. "Hang on- no, that's not possible. We can't be *stuck*." He said. "Yeah, I'd fucking hope we aren't." Amé hissed. Cisila sighed, "I'm going to check that now. Can you *please* just..." she couldn't continue her sentence. Queasiness overtook her. She had to get through this. Sliding down the ladder slowly, Cisila's boots thunked against the metal floor at the bottom of the cramped ladder space. She placed her hands on the levers to open the B-deck hatch, twisting them and clunking them into place. "It's not locked." She yelled back up to the group, and she pushed the hatch open. It creaked extremely loudly, the hinges crunching as the weight of the hatch moved.
