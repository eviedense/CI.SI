### -[The CSEP *Platinum Halberd*, Space {Standard Route Between Dvóniks and Lóivonus}]-
### -[Cisila J. Siveta, 26]-

Sparks of metal flew as Cisila put the welding torch against a metal plate, forcing it back into place with her free hand. It was a stupid solution, she thought to herself, but there was only so much gear on the ship. The torch sparked as it met the metal plate, and she begin to move the end of the torch along the plate's end, welding it into the other plates. It had blown off a couple of days ago, and nobody had been around to fix it. The sparking torch lit up the lower hull as Cisila brought it along the snapped plating, illuminating the various pipes, wires, and power cells. After she finished with the plate, Cisila got up and turned the welding torch off, flicking a switch on the grip with a small *click.* She shoved the welding torch into her harness, and strapped it in. Sighing, Cisila turned around and looked at the energy array of the *Halberd,* which powered most of the main systems. It was a metal casing which covered large energy cells filled with an ionic liquid that sent energy to the ship's data arrays, main computers, aswell as the ship's command bridge. The portion that Cisila could see looked small, even though she knew how big the energy cells really were, embedded into the hull. Yawning, Cisila pulled up the Hammerhead welding mask she'd been using, and rubbed her eyes. It was impossible to tell time properly in space, other than the coordinated timezones in space. Ever since boarding the *Platinum Halberd,* Cisila's sleep schedule had been messed up beyond belief. It was wake up, work, sleep. Wake up, work, sleep. All the windows showed the same starry emptiness as they usually did, occasionally revealing a planet in the distance. The ship, for the most part, floated freely in space, its engines off. But down in the lower hull, where most of the mechanical functions happened, Cisila could hear the warbling and consistent beating of the engine's systems. The main power source, a large reactor, hummed. The warbling came from the air-con systems, cycling air in and out of the ship and re-cooling it every minute. *All the same.*  Cisila thought, looking around. The plating had come off from the air-con systems, and the rest of the hull looked just like it. Metal plating. The cables coming down from the ceiling. An odd feeling of claustrophobia. The entire ship had that feeling, but down here...it felt especially cramped. Turning away from the systems, Cisila carefully made her way over to a ladder, illuminated by a dim, orange light, and she grabbed onto it. She was going to head straight back up to the main deck, to check how weapon development was going. The entire crew (consisting of about sixty to sixty-five people, she remembered) was assigned a lot of tasks each week, and this week, Cisila had to keep an eye on weapon development, one of the ship's main experiments. 

It would orbit the planet *Lúniks* occasionally, and transfer most of its data and finished work to teams down on the planet. Drug research, weapon development, specimen research, and combat training were the primary focuses of the ship. It had decently sized laboratories, firing ranges, and a gym. Singular. Most of the rooms were "decently sized" for the ship, as most were only accessible through cramped ladder climbs like the one Cisila was climbing up with. As she climbed up, her gear clanked and thunked against the metal tubing around her. Her harness was quite heavy on its own, with all of her engineer tools strapped to it. She was wearing a simple t-shirt and vest which the harness went over, aswell as large cargo pants fitted for extreme conditions. Connected to her harness was a toolbelt wrapping around her waist, holding several pieces of tech that could help her identify and solve problems with the ship. Along with her normal welding torch, strapped to the opposite side of her harness, was a plasma welder. It was used for more heavy duty work like the energy cells, of which it couldn't damage, while the normal welding torch - using pretty old technology - would likely cause the cells to burst, sending the ionic liquid everywhere. Pulling herself up the ladder and onto *D-Deck,* Cisila pulled off her welding faceshield and folded it up in her hands, shoving it into one of her toolbelt's many pouches. Looking down the hallway she'd ended up in, Cisila already knew where she was- the upper maintenance facilities, where most of the engineers hung out during the work hours. It was also where the giant and bulky repair suits sat when they weren't used, near the airlock at the end of the repair bay. Cisila tugged on the thing strapped to her forearm, a slim device that resembled a large phone from decades ago. It was Carbine's proprietary engineer info pad, assigned to every engineer on the ship. It could easily access the ship's systems, datalogs, and could communicate with other devices. But on Cisila's arm, it was *extremely* uncomfortable. She lifted her arm up so she could have a look at the screen, and as she did, it blipped to life. Its simple operating system immediately displayed what Cisila needed to see, and nothing else. First of all, a log of every repair done in the day. Hers was the only one listed, and was listed as *Plate repair - Engine level*. She put a finger to the screen and swiped right, bringing up a diagram of the ship. The screen shone brightly as it proudly displayed the *Halberd,* in all of its apparent glory. Only displaying one colour - a blinding golden yellow - Cisila looked at the ship for any other damages. As she was looking, her eyes scanning the screen, something beeped. She jumped. *Fuck!* Cisila thought, looking up, shaking her head. *That was my-* Before she could put together another coherent thought, a notification appeared on her screen. A call. She pressed the *Accept* prompt and flicked a switch on the side of the device, unmuting herself. "Cisila." A voice said. "Captain needs you to take care of something, since you're the closest to the repair bay on D-Deck." They said. "One of the starboard engines is flickering, and if it goes out, our drifting will go off course and it'll take a while to readjust. See if you can repair it." Cisila pursed her lips, before responding. "Yeah. Alright." She said. The person on the other end was Kellien, chief of security on the ship. She was usually the one to relay messages from the captain, Mr. Emdara, to Cisila. "Tell him it might take thirty or so minutes." She added, heading down the hallway to the repair bay. Her boots thunked against the metal of the floor. "I hate dealing with those engines." Cisila muttered as Kellien disconnected.

As Cisila climbed through the door into the repair bay, she saw the giant suits of metal sitting at the back end of the room, near the airlock. They were Hammerhead Heavy-Duty Exoskeleton And Titan Heart [HDEATH] repair suits, fitted for extreme space conditions. The "Titan Heart" part of the name referred to the odd power system and structure of the suit's exoskeleton, where pressure was maintained in the limbs with ionic liquids similar to the energy cells of the *Halberd* through an artificial "heart" in the back of the suit. Other than the exoskeleton, machined metal plating covered the armor, reminiscent of heavy duty power armor suits. But instead of weapons, the HDEATH suits were fitted with repair tools, such as a beefier version of Cisila's plasma welder, along with an array of different saws, claws, and other tools that were interchangeable. Cisila approached one slowly, and even despite it being turned away from her, it still towered over her. The handles to open up the back of the suit were large, and they were locked into place by safety latches. As she began to pull the safety latches, letting them click apart, another voice appeared in her ear, just like Kellien's. "How's the work going?" A familiar voice said. One of her engineer friends, probably up on a higher deck- Amélia, or just Amé. "S'good." Cisila responded, continuing to pull the safety latches off. "Getting into an aech-death, though." She added, blankly. "*Fuck.*" Amé said, hissing. "I hate those things." The HDEATH platform of suits were extremely useful, but the odd Titan Heart concept made everyone oddly uncomfortable. "Goddamned beating hearts..." Amé muttered. "What are you even doing, anyways?" She asked. "One of the starboard engines is out." Cisila explained, "I'm closest to it." She was on D-Deck's starboard side in the repair bay, which was one of two. The identical, but opposite one, was on the port side of D-Deck. "Oh, great." Amé muttered. "I *love* engine maintenance. Have fun." And with a click, Amé disconnected, going back to whatever she was doing. Cisila yanked the suit's handles back, and they clunked into place, freeing up the back of the suit. She pulled the back down, and, with a *hiss* from the suit's hydraulics, the entire back of the suits' legs came down aswell, letting Cisila climb in easily. She would still have to fit her head into the giant helmet, and position her arms in the sockets, too. 

Pulling herself into the suit, her feet pressed down on the pressure sensitive pads inside the suit's feet, and as they did, the back of the legs and suit lifted back up and sealed Cisila inside as she slid her arms through the sockets and into the suit's arms. As she settled herself in and let the suit turn on, she felt the suit whirr. The lenses of the helmet came to life, the HUD briefly blinding her as it adjusted itself to the lighting conditions. As the suit activated, she felt the heart in the back plating begin to beat. *Thunk. Thunk. Thunk.* It started fast, and hard, before slowing down and becoming less noticeable. As it beat, the arms, legs, and every joint of the armor came to life, letting Cisila move in the suit. Her arms dropped to her side smoothly, and she felt herself able to move her legs. She stepped backwards, and feeling the clunk of the heavy metal feet, Cisila oriented herself and stomped over to the airlock, reaching up to the ceiling and grabbing the handles to open the airlock with the HDEATH suit. Twisting the set of handles clockwise on one side, and counter-clockwise with the other to have them both oriented horizontally, Cisila thunked them into place and let go, stomping into the airlock before the door closed. As she got into the airlock, the doors snapped shut behind her and she felt all the air disappear, sucked back into the ship. Cisila rolled her head side to side, stretching her neck, waiting for the second set of doors to snap open and let her out onto the ship. The HDEATH system was fitted with repulsors and magnets, letting Cisila safely and easily scale and float to the starboard engine in need of repair. Suddenly, the doors snapped open, the heavy metal flying out of her way as the vacuum opened up into the room. Activating the magnets in the soles of the HDEATH suit, Cisila trudged slowly, tugging her feet up as if sticky gum was stuck to them. Each step towards the edge of the open room was excruciating. The endless void of space, filled with stars, awaited her. As she left the airlock, Cisila activated the repulsors on the back of the suit, aswell as the soles' pair of repulsors, and she oriented herself so both would propel her towards the rear of the ship, straight for the starboard engines. The ship was largely angular, metal panels and cables running along it. It was a precisely built craft, but a lot of its space seemed to go unused, stretching for far more distance than the standard decks took up. But, for all intents and purposes, the *Platinum Halberd* was the perfect research ship for Carbine. It had everything the crew needed, and as Cisila drifted along it, ascending up the side of it, she could see why Carbine paraded it around. It looked nice from the outside. But everything else...was a complete and utter mess. The interior was barely holding together, and the engineers - including herself - had to work around the clock to keep the ship functional. But for a moment...Cisila forgot her worries. She drifted along the ship in the HDEATH suit, admiring it. Admiring space. The endless nothingness may have been terrifying to some, but to her, the lack of noise was calming.

<sup><sub>Note: Cue in Under Cover from Halo Infinite</sub></sup>

In some of the windows, she could see crew members heading from one end of a deck to another, shunting supplies or test weapons into the frigate's various experimental areas and firing ranges. Some crew members were in modified HDEATH suits and were on the exterior of the ship, testing weapons in a vacuum. As she glided through the empty vastness of space towards the starboard engines, she waved at a pair of crew members testing what looked like a gauss cannon. They waved back. After a few short minutes of suspended gliding, Cisila pulled a grappling hook off of the HDEATH's toolbelt, and fired it into the ship, reeling herself in. She was close enough to magnetically walk towards the engine and start repairs. When she landed with a rough *thunk,* Cisila twisted a knob on the chest of the suit, turning on its radio. Immediately, it connected her to Kellien. "Almost at the starboard engines. Which one is it?" She asked. Kellien sighed, before checking. "Uppermost one. The engine itself should be flickering. Damage is...mostly external. Might've gotten hit." She rattled off. Kellien was obviously just reading off the damage report, but Cisila wasn't able to access it herself while in the HDEATH suit. "Thanks." Cisila muttered, finally jumping down onto the uppermost starboard engine. The engines were large, with bright, hot energy coming out of the exhausts. They were round with expertly crafted internals, making repairs from the outside rather easy. But right now, she just had to find whatever may have 'hit' the ship. In the HDEATH suit with its magnetic footholds on, Cisila stomped her way along the engine, scanning it from the helmet. She spotted a large dent that broke straight through the metal encasing of the engine, and quickly made her way towards it. "Got it." Cisila said. "Looks like some debris hit it, that's all." She could easily fix the damage with the large plasma welder connected to the suit. Cisila trudged over to the damage and kneeled down in the suit, pulling the plasma welder off of its magnetic holster. She turned it on, and it bursted to life, plasma globs dropping from the end of the welder. She peered into the damage, trying to see what caused it. An asteroid was lodged inside the engine, but it seemed to have stopped dead before hitting anything vital to the engine. Cisila lifted her free hand up and reversed the repulsor on the palm of the hand, pulling the asteroid out of the engine. She grabbed hold of it and noticed something...odd about it. It was glowing. Cracks permeated the surface, glowing a strange blue. *Odd.* Her mind echoed. She decided to strap it to the HDEATH suit, and bring it to the labs later. For now, she had to weld the damage back together and make sure everything was functional. First, she started with any interior damage she could find. Wires needed to be re-attached, and certain engine parts were broken. Welding the parts back together and re-fastening the wires, Cisila welded the exterior damage shut after a few minutes. "Repair complete." Cisila muttered, standing up. "Can confirm that it was an asteroid, but it looks weird. I'm bringing it in." She said. "Okay..." Kellien muttered. "You think it's worth a look?" she asked. Cisila thought so. Anything that glowed had *something* up with it. "Yeah." Cisila said. "Again- bringing it in. I'm done with the repair." 

-

Pulling herself out of the HDEATH suit carefully, Cisila pulled the asteroid piece off of it, shoving it under her arm. She was going to head up to B-deck with the asteroid, and give it to one of the researchers. Personally, while it *did* seem strange, Cisila wasn't entirely sure if it was truly anything special. Stepping out of the repair bay and back into the starboard D-deck hall, Cisila took a left turn to head for the central staircase. The staircase went to every deck, except for A-deck, where you needed special access. A *lot* of space was reserved for A-deck, even if the majority of the ship was B through D-decks, and due to this, every other deck felt cramped under the weight of what A-deck had. As Cisila entered the staircase and headed up to B-deck, she looked around. The staircase was generally brighter (and a little cleaner) than the maintenance hallways, but still seemed like it needed constant repair work. Climbing up the metal staircase, she passed a couple other crew members, who waved at her. They were too busy to say anything, either carrying experimental weapons or doing repairs on the staircase. She nodded back at them, and after a minute of climbing up, Cisila entered B-deck, portside. Immediately, the environment changed. The laboratories were pristine, and brighter than the rest of the ship. Amazingly bright white walls lined the hallways and the doors were trimmed in black to stand out, and she made her way towards one of the furthest lab rooms, Lab 2M. Portside labs were labelled '2', while starboard was '1'. Heading in, the door thunked open and slammed shut behind her rather aggressively, and she was greeted by a researcher. "Hey." They said, getting up from their seat at a testing bench. "What's up?" 

Cisila held up the asteroid, and the researcher stared at it. The first thing Cisila noticed about the girl was her stunning bright pink hair, which melted into black at the roots. Her face was thin, but not gaunt. She didn't look tired, unlike Cisila. "...Space rock." Cisila mumbled, a little stupidly. "Gah-" She shook her head. "Sorry." The girl snorted, and crossed her arms. "Space rock. Go on." She said, smiling. Cisila sighed, and actually put words together properly. "Hit the uppermost starboard engine. Not sure what it is, but it glows." She said, holding it up. The girl pursed her lips and stared at it for a moment. "...Can I have a look at it?" She asked. Cisila nodded, and held it out to her. "Oh, *cool*." The girl muttered, snatching the large asteroid. It glowed in her hands. "Name's Steph, by the way." She said to Cisila. "Don't think we've met. You're on the engineer team?" Steph added. Cisila nodded again, crossing her arms. "I've never gotten to use one of those suits. Whaddya call 'em..." Steph muttered, heading over to her research bench. She ripped a chunk of the asteroid out with such surprising strength that it made Cisila do a double take. She sputtered a response to Stepth, "Uh- aech-death. They're called aech-death suits." Steph looked back and nodded, "Yeaaah- those things. Dunno why everybody's so scared of them..." she muttered, beginning to test the chunk of rock she took. Cisila couldn't make heads or tails of what Steph was doing, but all she needed to know was that she was doing something. As Steph messed with the rock, Cisila walked up to one of the many large windows in the lab, staring out at space. Silence ensued. The only noises permeating the lab were Steph, who was trying to figure out a way to scan the asteroid. As Cisila watched the static outside, littered with stars, her mind drifted. When she was deep in thought, suddenly, the entire ship *thunked.* It rocked from one side to the other, sending Cisila one way and to the other, and Steph nearly got her foot crushed by the asteroid as it skidded off the research bench. "What the FUCK!?" Cisila yelled, catching herself on one of the research benches. The ship returned to its normal stability, letting Steph and Cisila take a breath. "Fuck..." Steph wheezed, shaking her head. "What the *hell* was that...?!" Before Cisila could try and answer, the shipwide announcement system blared to life with a set of beeps, making a chime. The voice that the both of them heard was of the captain, Emdara. The microphone for the system was blown out, and was barely used for that matter. If Emdara was using it, it had to be for a bad reason. "It- it looks like we've been..." Emdara struggled to explain. "Y'know-" He dropped his professional voice, "I'm not sure what happened. We've gone completely off course." *What?* Cisila thought, brow furrowing. Steph looked just as concerned. "...Our maps are freaking out." He said.

"Our navigation systems are still operational, but they say we're..." Emdara sighed. "They say we're- in the middle of nowhere. We're off the route." Cisila felt her heart drop. That was the worst possible thing that could happen. If the *Halberd* had gone off course, they couldn't ensure everybody's safety. And even worse, if they were in the middle of nowhere, then that meant there were no routes near them. It sounded as if they were in deep space. "Now, I know that *sounds* bad, but I've heard of this happening before." Emdara continued, "The ship should be equipped with a way to get us back on route in the event of something like this. It just...requires a lot of work." He muttered. "In the mean time, we-" He stopped. Something had made him pause. "...The *fuck?*" He hissed over the system. "Shit," Steph muttered, "This is *bad.*" *No fucking shit.* Cisila's mind echoed.
