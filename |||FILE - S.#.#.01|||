[The file's empty. But if you figure out how to check its history with your setup, you'll see many, many edits, dating back several years. The name, D.O.B, and age even show up.]
[The name reads: Dani Josert√©.]
[The D.O.B reads: March 21st, 20XX.]
[And the age...28.]
[It appears this person scrubbed their data, several times. It may even be the same person who edited Siveta's file.]
[Finding a half-finished draft from about two years ago, you start to read.]


- FILE UNFINISHED, DO NOT READ -

Subject Unknown, otherwise named S.U, is an extreme danger to PALMER-EDEN. Subject appears to be a part of a small local organization (higher-ups call it a cult) of people, supposedly as a group of "city protectors". They wear a strange white-and-red sweater,
decorated with different symbols. It is unknown what these symbols mean, but the CEO suspects they may be some kind of ranking system, despite how small this 'group' is.

This group possesses an extensive knowledge of combat & parkour. They mostly use melee, or silent weapons. Only ranged weapons observed in the hands of these people are a bunch of old MK22 Hush Puppy pistols, using non-lethal ammo.
Subject Unknown appears to be the leader of this small group.

What the group's purpose or goal is is not clear, and should be investigated. Until then, 

[And suddenly, the file stops there. It seems like whoever was writing it, likely someone slightly higher up the chain than the one writing Siveta's file, had to take care of something.]
[You go to close the file, having been disappointed by the like of information.]
[But as your cursor hovers over the 'X' button, you feel your phone vibrate. You swear you had notifications off, but pull it out anyways.]
[...There's nothing on it. You glance back up at your computer's monitor, but suddenly notice...something's been added to the file, in the second or so you were looking done.]
[It's a few words.]

Quit looking at this. Get out before P.E notices you. 

[You grumble to yourself and begrudgingly exit PALMER-EDEN's servers. This person must have been watching you.]
