The first time she held a gun, she was 14. Her father didn't like doing it. The Glock was pretty sizeable in her hands, and her father was reluctantly helping her shoot. "When you put the magazine in, make sure to pull the slide back. Else you'll waste valuable time."

Cisila looked up at her father, "Why couldn't I just pull the trigger twice?" Her father sighed. "That's what I mean. Would you rather pull the trigger in a tense situation, and nothing happens? Or rack the slide and solve your problems easily?" Oh. That made sense. She mumbled, "I think I get it." She never liked when her father was right like that.

By the end of that day, she had learned how to fire, reload, and strip a Glock. Now, she was holding a different pistol in her hands at a firing range inside a giant military building. She was a soldier now, and having her own weapons...she didn't like it. It felt as if she was suddenly forced into someone else's life, someone else's job. She hadn't had time to talk to Lyla, or Dani. 


She was alone. Or at least, it felt that way. The members of her new squad, DELTA squad, always tried to cheer her up. That's why she was at the firing range, and suddenly she realized she was just standing there, staring at the pistol in her hands. Cisila lifted her head up, and noticed Ducain messing with his rifle. It seemed to have jammed...

She shoved the pistol into her holster and walked over to him, and mumbled to him, "It's jammed...pull the bolt back."
Ducain, a pretty large man, turned his head to look at her. His strange pale blue eyes scanned her. "Oh. I- hm, yeah, that would help." He racked the bolt, and the bullet, still in its casing, flew out of the ejection port. Ducain caught it. He pulled the magazine out of the rifle and slid the bullet back into the top of the mag. "I need to practice more." Cisila raised an eyebrow, and raised her voice the smallest bit, "...Practice? Aren't you the one who's been in this squad the longest?"

Ducain rolled his eyes. "I- I meant with the rifle. It's not what I'm used to."


Oh. That made sense. "I'm going back." She muttered, and turned away, walking towards the door. "But you haven't even-" Ducain wasn't able to finish his sentence as Cisila shut the door behind her.


As soon as she got back to her quarters (which were strangely large and well decorated) she slumped into her chair and leaned back. She hadn't even done that much, and she felt tired. Cisila was always, *always* tired here. She never felt at home, and the amount of things she had to do every day killed her motivation to do anything else. Just a few days ago, they had been sent out on a mission to Africa to take out a "traitor" American cell hiding out in Mali. 
She crossed her arms and went over the situation again in her head...

"Alright, NVGs down, flashlights off. We can't be seen." This statement from DELTA-PRIME was followed by a series of small clicks as the squad's flashlights flicked off, and then a small whirr as they pulled their NVGs down. Cisila was the last to follow, and the green lights of her NVGs was offputting. She hadn't used these in a proper environment before.


"Move up, Six. There's a good sniper position here, and I'd like you to take it up." Cisila moved forward, closer towards the edge of the cliff they were on. There was a small spot where she could lie down between an outcropping of rocks, hidden on all sides, except for behind her. "This should work," she muttered, and pulled out her sniper rifle, a TAC-338. It had no suppressor attached, but at this distance (she estimated a good few hundred metres, at least) the enemy wouldn't hear it. Hopefully. "Alright- the rest of you, keep moving. Four, stay with Six." DELTA-PRIME always spoke so matter-of-factly, she noticed. It was like she blocked out all of her other emotions, and focused on the current situation. Cisila wished she could do that...

Whatever. It didn't matter- Cisila got down on her stomach and crawled into the sniper position, and readied her rifle, placing it on its tripod. She had a pretty reasonable view of the warehouse the enemy was hiding in, put couldn't see the rest of the squad yet. Obviously, they were now rappeling down the cliffside, staying as quiet as possible. Ducain sat on a rock, crossing his legs. Cisila looked back at him, and though he couldn't see her face properly, she was scowling. "I keep telling her I don't need anyone to help." Ducain cocked his head to the side, "Yeah, and I know you don't. I'm not a spotter, anyway." Cisila rolled her eyes under her NVGs, "Then you should be going with them." Cisila turned back to the sniper rifle, and peered down the scope. She tried to adjust the scope, but couldn't seem to get it quite right. She muttered, "How far are we?" 

"About 550 metres." Huh? Cisila looked back. "Give or take a few." Ducain calmly said. "Uh...thanks?" She mumbled, turning, once more, back to the rifle. She adjusted it to the correct distance. Her radio came to life, and she heard DELTA-PRIME's voice in her ear,

"We're approaching the warehouse. Six, you got visual?"

Cisila peered down the scope once more, and couldn't see anything: "Negative. No visual. Switching to thermal." She flicked a switch on the scope, and pulled her NVGs up, turning them off. Looking through the thermal scope, she saw a sniper posted on a window, in the direction the rest of DELTA was heading. "Hang on- sniper. In the window." DELTA-PRIME responded, "Shit. Take 'em out." She breathed in slowly, gripping the pistol grip of the rifle, and holding the underbarrel with her other hand. *Target is somewhere between 540-550 metres.*  She aimed the scope a little higher, accounting for bullet drop. She couldn't feel any wind. She slowly pulled the trigger down. There was a click...and then the rifle boomed. The bullet flew right towards the target and went right through their head. Through the scope, she could see the sniper's rifle falling out of the window and into the ground below. "...Tango down." She felt her hands shaking. She hated staying still like this. She lifted the bolt and racked it. The casing flung out of the ejection port with a small *ping*, and collided with the rocks next to her, clattering to the ground.

She noticed she was sweating. Even at night, this place was strangely warm. 

"Six, think I spotted another one. East side."

Cisila turned the rifle to look at the east side. Sure enough, another soldier was peeking out of a window right above the back entrance- the one the squad was going to use. "Copy." She muttered. This one was closer, she observed, somewhere between 515-525 metres. This time, she felt some wind. It wasn't too strong, but she felt that it would put the bullet off course. She pressed down a button on her radio, and spoke. "Just a fair warning. I might miss. Some wind kicked in. Can someone get him if I miss?" DELTA-5 responded, "I gotcha." She saw, down on the ground, that Five was moving towards a set of shipping containers. There, he'd have a good opportunity to shoot the soldier if she missed.

"Ready?" She said. "Ready." Five responded.


She pulled the trigger. The rifle boomed once more, and the recoil hit her hard. The next second or so was agonizing. Suddenly- "Shit!" Five said over the radio, "You got him in the shoulder - he's moving back. Shit, shit!" Cisila held down the button on her radio again, "You need to move inside. If they catch us now, I don't think I'll be able to pick all you guys out from the bad guys."

The rest of the team, aside from Ducain, who was quietly sitting, cursed. DELTA-PRIME spoke up, "Six is right. Breach, ASAP. Going loud."

What? That's not what she meant. "No, don't go loud. Try to stay quiet as long as-"

DELTA-PRIME interrupted her. "We've got grenade launchers. We'll be fine." Cisila grumbled, "Fine."

She attached the C4 breach charge to the door and stepped back, raising a hand. "Take cover." She ducked around the corner, followed by DELTA-5 and DELTA-2, while DELTA-3 hung back in a different position. Alex pulled out the detonator, and pressed down the button. It clicked, and in a flash, the door blew off its hinges with a loud *bang*, and the four moved in. DELTA-5 went first, checking corners. Alex herself went next, following right behind Five. The warehouse was large, dingy, and filled with ship containers. Five went around a corner, and suddenly - he opened fire. The blinding muzzle flashes of his rifle illuminated the alley between the ship containers where they were moving, and Alex spotted a couple men moving back. She ducked between another set of ship containers, pulling down her NVGs and approaching the spot where the men were. She rounded the corner, and realized she was too close. She dropped her rifle (which flung back under her arm, as it was attached to a sling) pulled out her combat knife and cut through one of the men in one clean motion. The second man noticed her, and pulled out his pistol. Before he could even get a shot off, Alex lunged forward, and swiftly, she ripped apart the pistol in the man's hands, broke his arm and slammed him straight into the ground. She looked up, "Clear. Move on." 

She stared down at the man, and without any feeling of remorse, she unholstered her pistol and shot him through the head. The mission was to kill them all, of course, and that was what she was going to do. She motioned towards the rest of the squad to keep moving. They sweeped through the first floor of the warehouse, but found nothing. The soldiers must have booked it already and were outside. Alex switched on her radio, "Six, do you-" but she wasn't able to finish her sentence. She heard soldiers outside yell "SNIPER!" which was followed by the subtle *booms* of Six's sniper rifle. Two turned to Alex, grinding his teeth. "We need to get out of there. Six can't take them out alone." Five and Three nodded, and Alex grumbled. "Get a move on, then." She led the squad outside, and as soon as they got outside, she remembered something...

Six wouldn't be able to tell who was who. These American traitors had the same gear as them- Alex swore under her breath and stopped the squad. She flicked on her radio, "Six. For the love of God, please watch your fire. We're coming out."

Six responded, in her quiet mumble, "Roger that..." She seemed focus. That was the thing Alex liked about Six: when she was focused, she'd do her damn job. And she'd do it better than the one replaced, nine times out of ten. But whenever they were off duty, she'd shrink into the background. Alex wanted to wonder why, but it wasn't important, therefore, she ignored it. 

She lifted her rifle back up. "You boys know what to do. Let's get this over with and get the hell outta here." Deltas Two, Three and Five all nodded. They rushed towards the group of traitors, who were running for it. Alex thought they had hidden their vehicles somewhere, and were running for them. They wouldn't get there. She held down the trigger of her rifle and emptied the magazine in the general direction of the running men. The muzzle of her rifle illuminated the path they were following every time it flashed after a shot. They were following a small dirt path towards a smaller warehouse - it must be where they keep their vehicles, she thought. But before she could even think of stopping them...

A large, dual-propellered helicopter flew over them- she'd somehow not heard it until just now. Her eyes went wide under her NVGs as she saw a large machine gun stapled to the side of the helicopter swivel towards them, and she yelled "GET DOWN!"

Cisila swore under her breath. That helicopter would take the rest of them out, if it could find them. She'd completely lost the rest of the squad as they dove into the brush, and they'd be safe for at least a couple of minutes. Behind her, she heard Ducain get up and approach her. "I might have something that can stop that chopper." He said, seeming straight to the point. She turned to look at him, and lifted her NVGs. "Unless you've got an RPG up your sleeve, nothing's taking that down." She turned away after she said this, and heard him pull something out of his vest. She decided not to pay attention, and instead kept her scope trained on the second warehouse. The soldiers had gotten inside, but for some reason hadn't left yet. Something clicked behind her...it must be Ducain, she thought. The hell was he doing? And then another click. And then suddenly...the helicopter burst into flames. She looked up in shock - the flames were as bright as the sun in the pitch black of this abandoned desert.

She racked the bolt of her rifle once more as she noticed the soldiers, equally as shocked, peered out of the building. Like DELTA-PRIME said, the mission was why they were here. She begin firing on the warehouse, hitting a soldier every now and then. In the middle of this, her radio sputtered and crackled with various "Got him!" and "Outta the way!" from the other squad members- she couldn't tell where they were, but soon enough, after she had to reload for the second time, every soldier was on the ground - dead.

The helicopter had whirled out of control and crashed rather loudly over a hill. "Six, Four - get down here. We need to get out of here." Oh. Great. PRIME wanted them down there. She got up, picked up her rifle, and headed towards the area where the squad descended, with Ducain following behind her. The two climbed down the cliffside, and once on the ground, they walked across the sand towards the path, and entered the warehouse. The squad had begun to relax, because now they were alone. No targets, nothing. Two was sitting on a box. Five was leaning against a workshop desk. Three was sitting, hands in his face.

Cisila grabbed a chair, tugged it over to where the rest of the squad was sitting. She sat back in it, and it creaked weakly. Ducain just sat on the floor. DELTA-PRIME sighed, "Evac's not going to be here for a couple of hours."

And so they waited. And waited. In complete and utter silence, they stayed there until they heard the loud, whirring rotors of a large VTOL aircraft. They were finally going to get back - and hopefully, they'd get a rest.
