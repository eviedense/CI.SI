The first time she held a gun, she was 14. Her father didn't like doing it. The Glock was pretty sizeable in her hands, and her father was reluctantly helping her shoot. "When you put the magazine in, make sure to pull the slide back. Else you'll waste valuable time."

Cisila looked up at her father, "Why couldn't I just pull the trigger twice?" Her father sighed. "That's what I mean. Would you rather pull the trigger in a tense situation, and nothing happens? Or rack the slide and solve your problems easily?" Oh. That made sense. She mumbled, "I think I get it." She never liked when her father was right like that.

By the end of that day, she had learned how to fire, reload, and strip a Glock. Now, she was holding a different pistol in her hands at a firing range inside a giant military building. She was a soldier now, and having her own weapons...she didn't like it. It felt as if she was suddenly forced into someone else's life, someone else's job. She hadn't had time to talk to Lyla, or Dani. 


She was alone. Or at least, it felt that way. The members of her new squad, DELTA squad, always tried to cheer her up. That's why she was at the firing range, and suddenly she realized she was just standing there, staring at the pistol in her hands. Cisila lifted her head up, and noticed Ducain messing with his rifle. It seemed to have jammed...

She shoved the pistol into her holster and walked over to him, and mumbled to him, "It's jammed...pull the bolt back."
Ducain, a pretty large man, turned his head to look at her. His strange pale blue eyes scanned her. "Oh. I- hm, yeah, that would help." He racked the bolt, and the bullet, still in its casing, flew out of the ejection port. Ducain caught it. He pulled the magazine out of the rifle and slid the bullet back into the top of the mag. "I need to practice more." Cisila raised an eyebrow, and raised her voice the smallest bit, "...Practice? Aren't you the one who's been in this squad the longest?"

Ducain rolled his eyes. "I- I meant with the rifle. It's not what I'm used to."


Oh. That made sense. "I'm going back." She muttered, and turned away, walking towards the door. "But you haven't even-" Ducain wasn't able to finish his sentence as Cisila shut the door behind her.


As soon as she got back to her quarters (which were strangely large and well decorated) she slumped into her chair and leaned back. She hadn't even done that much, and she felt tired. Cisila was always, *always* tired here. She never felt at home, and the amount of things she had to do every day killed her motivation to do anything else. Just a few days ago, they had been sent out on a mission to Africa to take out a "traitor" American cell hiding out in Mali. 
She crossed her arms and went over the situation again in her head...

"Alright, NVGs down, flashlights off. We can't be seen." This statement from DELTA-PRIME was followed by a series of small clicks as the squad's flashlights flicked off, and then a small whirr as they pulled their NVGs down. Cisila was the last to follow, and the green lights of her NVGs was offputting. She hadn't used these in a proper environment before.


"Move up, Six. There's a good sniper position here, and I'd like you to take it up." Cisila moved forward, closer towards the edge of the cliff they were on. There was a small spot where she could lie down between an outcropping of rocks, hidden on all sides, except for behind her. "This should work," she muttered, and pulled out her sniper rifle, a TAC-338. It had no suppressor attached, but at this distance (she estimated a good few hundred metres, at least) the enemy wouldn't hear it. Hopefully. "Alright- the rest of you, keep moving. Four, stay with Six." DELTA-PRIME always spoke so matter-of-factly, she noticed. It was like she blocked out all of her other emotions, and focused on the current situation. Cisila wished she could do that...

Whatever. It didn't matter- Cisila got down on her stomach and crawled into the sniper position, and readied her rifle, placing it on its tripod. She had a pretty reasonable view of the warehouse the enemy was hiding in, put couldn't see the rest of the squad yet. Obviously, they were now rappeling down the cliffside, staying as quiet as possible. Ducain sat on a rock, crossing his legs. Cisila looked back at him, and though he couldn't see her face properly, she was scowling. "I keep telling her I don't need anyone to help." Ducain cocked his head to the side, "Yeah, and I know you don't. I'm not a spotter, anyway." Cisila rolled her eyes under her NVGs, "Then you should be going with them." Cisila turned back to the sniper rifle, and peered down the scope. She tried to adjust the scope, but couldn't seem to get it quite right. She muttered, "How far are we?" 

"About 550 metres." Huh? Cisila looked back. "Give or take a few." Ducain calmly said. "Uh...thanks?" She mumbled, turning, once more, back to the rifle. She adjusted it to the correct distance. Her radio came to life, and she heard DELTA-PRIME's voice in her ear,

"We're approaching the warehouse. Six, you got visual?"

Cisila peered down the scope once more, and couldn't see anything: "Negative. No visual. Switching to thermal." She flicked a switch on the scope, and pulled her NVGs up, turning them off. Looking through the thermal scope, she saw a sniper posted on a window, in the direction the rest of DELTA was heading. "Hang on- sniper. In the window." DELTA-PRIME responded, "Shit. Take 'em out." She breathed in slowly, gripping the pistol grip of the rifle, and holding the underbarrel with her other hand. *Target is somewhere between 540-550 metres.*  She aimed the scope a little higher, accounting for bullet drop. She couldn't feel any wind. She slowly pulled the trigger down. There was a click...and then the rifle boomed. The bullet flew right towards the target and went right through their head. Through the scope, she could see the sniper's rifle falling out of the window and into the ground below. "...Tango down." She felt her hands shaking. She hated staying still like this. She lifted the bolt and racked it. The casing flung out of the ejection port with a small *ping*, and collided with the rocks next to her, clattering to the ground.

She noticed she was sweating. Even at night, this place was strangely warm. 

"Six, think I spotted another one. East side."

Cisila turned the rifle to look at the east side. Sure enough, another soldier was peeking out of a window right above the back entrance- the one the squad was going to use. "Copy." She muttered. This one was closer, she observed, somewhere between 515-525 metres. This time, she felt some wind. It wasn't too strong, but she felt that it would put the bullet off course. She pressed down a button on her radio, and spoke. "Just a fair warning. I might miss. Some wind kicked in. Can someone get him if I miss?" DELTA-5 responded, "I gotcha." She saw, down on the ground, that Five was moving towards a set of shipping containers. There, he'd have a good opportunity to shoot the soldier if she missed.

"Ready?" She said. "Ready." Five responded.


She pulled the trigger. The rifle boomed once more, and the recoil hit her hard. The next second or so was agonizing. Suddenly- "Shit!" Five said over the radio, "You got him in the shoulder - he's moving back. Shit, shit!" Cisila held down the button on her radio again, "You need to move inside. If they catch us now, I don't think I'll be able to pick all you guys out from the bad guys."

The rest of the team, aside from Ducain, who was quietly sitting, cursed. DELTA-PRIME spoke up, "Six is right. Breach, ASAP. Going loud."

What? That's not what she meant. "No, don't go loud. Try to stay quiet as long as-"

DELTA-PRIME interrupted her. "We've got grenade launchers. We'll be fine." Cisila grumbled, "Fine."
