The first time she held a gun, she was 14. Her father didn't like doing it. The Glock was pretty sizeable in her hands, and her father was reluctantly helping her shoot. "When you put the magazine in, make sure to pull the slide back. Else you'll waste valuable time."

Cisila looked up at her father, "Why couldn't I just pull the trigger twice?" Her father sighed. "That's what I mean. Would you rather pull the trigger in a tense situation, and nothing happens? Or rack the slide and solve your problems easily?" Oh. That made sense. She mumbled, "I think I get it." She never liked when her father was right like that.

By the end of that day, she had learned how to fire, reload, and strip a Glock. Now, she was holding a different pistol in her hands at a firing range inside a giant military building. She was a soldier now, and having her own weapons...she didn't like it. It felt as if she was suddenly forced into someone else's life, someone else's job. She hadn't had time to talk to Lyla, or Dani. 


She was alone. Or at least, it felt that way. The members of her new squad, DELTA squad, always tried to cheer her up. That's why she was at the firing range, and suddenly she realized she was just standing there, staring at the pistol in her hands. Cisila lifted her head up, and noticed Ducain messing with his rifle. It seemed to have jammed...

She shoved the pistol into her holster and walked over to him, and mumbled to him, "It's jammed...pull the bolt back."
Ducain, a pretty large man, turned his head to look at her. His strange pale blue eyes scanned her. "Oh. I- hm, yeah, that would help." He racked the bolt, and the bullet, still in its casing, flew out of the ejection port. Ducain caught it. He pulled the magazine out of the rifle and slid the bullet back into the top of the mag. "I need to practice more." Cisila raised an eyebrow, and raised her voice the smallest bit, "...Practice? Aren't you the one who's been in this squad the longest?"

Ducain rolled his eyes. "I- I meant with the rifle. It's not what I'm used to."


Oh. That made sense. "I'm going back." She muttered, and turned away, walking towards the door. "But you haven't even-" Ducain wasn't able to finish his sentence as Cisila shut the door behind her.


As soon as she got back to her quarters (which were strangely large and well decorated) she slumped into her chair and leaned back. She hadn't even done that much, and she felt tired. Cisila was always, *always* tired here. She never felt at home, and the amount of things she had to do every day killed her motivation to do anything else. Just a few days ago, they had been sent out on a mission to Africa to take out a "traitor" American cell hiding out in Mali. 
She crossed her arms and went over the situation again in her head...

"Alright, NVGs down, flashlights off. We can't be seen." This statement from DELTA-PRIME was followed by a series of small clicks as the squad's flashlights flicked off, and then a small whirr as they pulled their NVGs down. Cisila was the last to follow, and the green lights of her NVGs was offputting. She hadn't used these in a proper environment before.


"Move up, Six. There's a good sniper position here, and I'd like you to take it up." Cisila moved forward, closer towards the edge of the cliff they were on. There was a small spot where she could lie down between an outcropping of rocks, hidden on all sides, except for behind her. "This should work," she muttered, and pulled out her sniper rifle, a TAC-338. It had no suppressor attached, but at this distance (she estimated a good few hundred metres, at least) the enemy wouldn't hear it. Hopefully. "Alright- the rest of you, keep moving. Four, stay with Six." DELTA-PRIME always spoke so matter-of-factly, she noticed. It was like she blocked out all of her other emotions, and focused on the current situation. Cisila wished she could do that...
