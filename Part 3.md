#### SGT. CISILA J. SIVETA, 24

Twigs crunched under her boots as Cisila made her way through the tangled brush. Behind her, someone else followed. In the middle of the wilderness, she felt lost in the dark. But she and the squad she'd been assigned to had to remain in the dark as they creeped out towards an old warehouse. Her military gear weighed her down...and a band wrapped around her arm sapped her of any Ultima abilities. When she had first put it on, it felt like she had contracted a virus. But now...it felt more like a weight on her heart. The only thing she'd have left to stay alive during her military career would be her own hands. Under her boots, she felt more twigs crunch. They were as dry as a desert...and every single one was a noisemaker waiting to mess something up. She looked behind her, and could only barely see the silhouette of her squadmate, Ducain. They were the only two on this end of the warehouse, and the other four members of the squad were approaching from the north and west ends, respectively. They were heading in on the east end.

Suddenly, Cisila heard her radio crackle to life, the earpiece in her ear emitting static. she reached up to her radio and turned the tuner to the proper frequency. What come through was the squad leader, DELTA-LEADER. ***"Four, Six. We're in position. Where are you?"*** Cisila sighed, then, holding down another button on the radio, she mumbled, "Almost there. Getting tangled in the trees." She pulled herself past a particularly sharp branch, and then behind her, she heard Ducain. "I think we're ready nonetheless. What's our goal again?" Sliding through bushes, Cisila carefully listened to DELTA-LEADER's next words. ***"Our goal is to neutralize the threat in the warehouse- it's going to be in close quarters, so remember to watch your fire. And don't, for fuck's sake, ever shoot any of the IEDs they've got in there."*** She heard cluttered responses from the rest of the squad. "Right," she added in. ***"Alright then, if we're all in position..."*** Cisila pushed aside frail bushes and finally saw the warehouse. ***"NVGs down. Safety off. Let's hit 'em hard."*** Cisila groaned and pulled down the heavy set of nightvision goggles drilled onto her helmet. With a quiet whirr and click, she was momentarily blinded by the pale green lights that let her see. After her eyes adjusted, she reached behind her and yanked her shotgun off her backpack. The hefty metal firearm was unwieldy, but it was the only kind of gun she'd bother to use in close-quarters. She couldn't handle assault rifles, and pistols didn't do enough to help her in this kind of situation. She dropped her left hand to her ammo pouches, and pulled out a shotgun round. She pulled back the charging handle on the shotgun and dropped the round in. The charging handle snapped forward. She now had an additional round in her shotgun- and she signalled to Ducain with her hand to move forward.

The two rushed through the remaining brush and quietly ran up to the side door they'd be entering. They had to wait until the lights switched off- Three and Five's doing. Positioning themselves near the door to remain unseen, they waited in silence. In her head, Cisila counted the seconds. It should only take a couple of minutes for the power to go out. And then...right on cue, the lights flickered out. Ducain looked to Cisila, nodded, and stepped in front of the door. Before he entered, he raised his hand to his radio and held down one of the buttons. "Going loud. You ready?" Cisila heard crackled acknowledgements from the other members. Ducain pulled a crowbar off of his backpack and jammed it between the door and the wall. Pulling aggressively, he used his strength to break the door open. With a *snap,* the door flew open. Cisila raised her shotgun and slid inside. Once inside, she moved down the hallway with her shotgun pointing down every empty room she could spot. Most doors were left open, as the former employees of the warehouse ran for their lives.
