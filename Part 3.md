### JULY 5TH, 2035
#### SGT. CISILA J. SIVETA, 24

Twigs crunched under her boots as Cisila made her way through the tangled brush. Behind her, someone else followed. In the middle of the wilderness, she felt lost in the dark. But she and the squad she'd been assigned to had to remain in the dark as they creeped out towards an old warehouse. Her military gear weighed her down...and a band wrapped around her arm sapped her of any Ultima abilities. When she had first put it on, it felt like she had contracted a virus. But now...it felt more like a weight on her heart. The only thing she'd have left to stay alive during her military career would be her own hands. Under her boots, she felt more twigs crunch. They were as dry as a desert...and every single one was a noisemaker waiting to mess something up. She looked behind her, and could only barely see the silhouette of her squadmate, Ducain. They were the only two on this end of the warehouse, and the other four members of the squad were approaching from the north and west ends, respectively. They were heading in on the east end.

Suddenly, Cisila heard her radio crackle to life, the earpiece in her ear emitting static. she reached up to her radio and turned the tuner to the proper frequency. What come through was the squad leader, DELTA-LEADER, or just Kellien, as Cisila called her. ***"Four, Six. We're in position. Where are you?"*** Cisila sighed, then, holding down another button on the radio, she mumbled, "Almost there. Getting tangled in the trees." She pulled herself past a particularly sharp branch, and then behind her, she heard Ducain. "I think we're ready nonetheless. What's our goal again?" Sliding through bushes, Cisila carefully listened to DELTA-LEADER's next words. ***"Our goal is to neutralize the threat in the warehouse- it's going to be in close quarters, so remember to watch your fire. And don't, for fuck's sake, ever shoot any of the IEDs they've got in there."*** She heard cluttered responses from the rest of the squad. "Right," she added in. ***"Alright then, if we're all in position..."*** Cisila pushed aside frail bushes and finally saw the warehouse. ***"NVGs down. Safety off. Let's hit 'em hard."*** Cisila groaned and pulled down the heavy set of nightvision goggles drilled onto her helmet. With a quiet whirr and click, she was momentarily blinded by the pale green lights that let her see. After her eyes adjusted, she reached behind her and yanked her shotgun off her backpack. The hefty metal firearm was unwieldy, but it was the only kind of gun she'd bother to use in close-quarters. She couldn't handle assault rifles, and pistols didn't do enough to help her in this kind of situation. She dropped her left hand to her ammo pouches, and pulled out a shotgun round. She pulled back the charging handle on the shotgun and dropped the round in. The charging handle snapped forward. She now had an additional round in her shotgun- and she signalled to Ducain with her hand to move forward.

The two rushed through the remaining brush and quietly ran up to the side door they'd be entering. They had to wait until the lights switched off- Three and Five's doing. Positioning themselves near the door to remain unseen, they waited in silence. In her head, Cisila counted the seconds. It should only take a couple of minutes for the power to go out. And then...right on cue, the lights flickered out. Ducain looked to Cisila, nodded, and stepped in front of the door. Before he entered, he raised his hand to his radio and held down one of the buttons. "Going loud. You ready?" Cisila heard crackled acknowledgements from the other members. Ducain pulled a crowbar off of his backpack and jammed it between the door and the wall. Pulling aggressively, he used his strength to break the door open. With a *snap,* the door flew open. Cisila raised her shotgun and slid inside. Once inside, she moved down the hallway with her shotgun pointing down every empty room she could spot. Most doors were left open, as the former employees of the warehouse ran for their lives. Nothing jumped out at her- nobody shot her in the head. She signalled for Ducain to follow her to the next door into the main warehouse. "Entering the warehouse," Cisila muttered into the radio. She grabbed the rusty door handle, and cranked it downwards. 

Slowly pushing the door open, she scanned the warehouse. Rusting red, blue and grey shipping containers dominated the space, creating a large and confusing maze. Ducain walked up next to her. "Think they're hiding in there?" He motioned towards the shipping container maze. Cisila nodded. "Split up. Meet back here if you don't find anyone-" She paused. "If you do find someone, radio it. Then go find the captain." She was referring to the squad leader- Ducain jerked his head, which she assumed was a nod, and she set off towards a gap in the shipping containers. She held her shotgun up, bracing it against her shoulder. In the dark, with her night vision, the only thing she could see ahead of her were more shipping containers. More corners. Ducking around another corner, she heard something. *Footsteps,* her mind echoed. She immediately felt herself tense up as she approached where she thought the sound came from. One step after the other, she got closer. And then behind her, she heard a click. She instantly whipped around and saw someone trying to sneak up on her. She felt her surroundings slow down for a moment as her finger moved to the shotgun's trigger. When she pulled the trigger, she felt the shotgun fire, and its stock flew back into her shoulder. The loud *bang* that came from the firearm surely would have alerted anyone else- but she didn't care. She flung her shotgun back over her shoulder, which hung on for dear life on its strap, and pulled out a combat knife. If her shotgun didn't do enough damage, *she* would. She lunged towards the man on the ground, who was reeling in pain. The shotgun pellets had hit him all over, and even in night vision, she could see blood seeping through his outfit.

He wasn't armored, at least not to the extension that she and Delta squad were. Cisila flipped the knife around in her hand, grabbed the man's neck, and feeling herself flinch, she drove the knife into his head. Pulling the knife out, she wiped it off and shoved it back in its sheathe. "Who shot first?" Kellien suddenly interrupted, her voice over the radio barely coming through. Cisila shook her head for a second, exhaled, and held down a button on her radio. "Me. Anyone got anybody else?" She asked. "I got a couple idiots tryin' to hide in some lockers." Five said. "Took one down in the containers," Ducain added. "They definitely know we're here." Cisila pulled her shotgun back into her arms and continued to make her way through the maze. She would turn a corner, spot another similarly dressed target, and shoot him down. They seemed to be panicking- but she couldn't hold any remorse for them. They had stolen plans from the U.S Government. 

And usually, when you steal from the U.S Government, it isn't going to end good. She knew that perfectly well. Not only had they stolen the plans- they'd managed to kill anyone else coming for them. They had resorted to running to Congo, where they were now. Cisila thought they'd only been able to catch them like this because they thought they were safe. They weren't. They never would be again, so long as they were alive. She didn't envy that. Rounding another corner, she finally ended up back outside the shipping container maze. "I'm out of the containers," She said into her radio. "Moving to the next floor. Watch your fire." Muttered acknowledgements came through the radio as she moved towards the door to the stairwell. "Hang on-" Someone suddenly said from her left. Kellien had appeared out of nowhere. "They've armed that stairwell with a bunch of explosives." She said. She was sweating heavily- her unkempt black hair was going every which way. "How can you tell?" Cisila asked. Kellien paused, peering through the door's window. "I mean...just look." Cisila peeked through aswell. She could just barely see tripwires and small squares haphazardly fastened to the walls. Barrels were sitting on either side of the door, which probably meant that if she opened the door, she'd hit a tripwire. Cisila groaned, and stepped back. "Then where do we go?" She asked. Kellien laughed, "Really?" Cisila tilted her head, confused. "This isn't anybody's property anymore." Suddenly, Kellien smashed the window to the door open. She reached down to her vest and pulled a grenade off her ammo belt. "They won't be able to use it either after I'm done." Cisila reached forward to try and stop her- but she'd already pulled the pin on the grenade. "What the hell are you-" Cisila sputtered, but it was too late. Kellien lobbed the grenade through the broken window, and it clattered along the floor of the stairwell.
