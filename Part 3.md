The first time she held a gun, she was 14. Her father didn't like doing it. The Glock was pretty sizeable in her hands, and her father was reluctantly helping her shoot. "When you put the magazine in, make sure to pull the slide back. Else you'll waste valuable time."

Cisila looked up at her father, "Why couldn't I just pull the trigger twice?" Her father sighed. "That's what I mean. Would you rather pull the trigger in a tense situation, and nothing happens? Or rack the slide and solve your problems easily?" Oh. That made sense. She mumbled, "I think I get it." She never liked when her father was right like that.

By the end of that day, she had learned how to fire, reload, and strip a Glock. Now, she was holding a different pistol in her hands at a firing range inside a giant military building. She was a soldier now, and having her own weapons...she didn't like it. It felt as if she was suddenly forced into someone else's life, someone else's job. She hadn't had time to talk to Lyla, or Dani. 


She was alone. Or at least, it felt that way. The members of her new squad, DELTA squad, always tried to cheer her up. That's why she was at the firing range, and suddenly she realized she was just standing there, staring at the pistol in her hands. Cisila lifted her head up, and noticed Ducain messing with his rifle. It seemed to have jammed...

She shoved the pistol into her holster and walked over to him, and mumbled to him, "It's jammed...pull the bolt back."
Ducain, a pretty large man, turned his head to look at her. His strange pale blue eyes scanned her. "Oh. I- hm, yeah, that would help." He racked the bolt, and the bullet, still in its casing, flew out of the ejection port. Ducain caught it. He pulled the magazine out of the rifle and slid the bullet back into the top of the mag. "I need to practice more." Cisila raised an eyebrow, and raised her voice the smallest bit, "...Practice? Aren't you the one who's been in this squad the longest?"

Ducain rolled his eyes. "I- I meant with the rifle. It's not what I'm used to."


Oh. That made sense. "I'm going back." She muttered, and turned away, walking towards the door. "But you haven't even-" Ducain wasn't able to finish his sentence as Cisila shut the door behind her.


As soon as she got back to her quarters (which were strangely large and well decorated) she slumped into her chair and leaned back. She hadn't even done that much, and she felt tired. Cisila was always, *always* tired here. She never felt at home, and the amount of things she had to do every day killed her motivation to do anything else. Just a few days ago, they had been sent out on a mission to Africa to take out a "traitor" American cell hiding out in Mali. 
She crossed her arms and went over the situation again in her head...

"Alright, NVGs down, flashlights off. We can't be seen." This statement from DELTA-PRIME was followed by a series of small clicks as the squad's flashlights flicked off, and then a small whirr as they pulled their NVGs down. Cisila was the last to follow, and the green lights of her NVGs was offputting. She hadn't used these in a proper environment before.


"Move up, Six. There's a good sniper position here, and I'd like you to take it up." Cisila moved forward, closer towards the edge of the cliff they were on. There was a small spot where she could lie down between an outcropping of rocks, hidden on all sides, except for behind her. "This should work," she muttered, and pulled out her sniper rifle, a TAC-338. It had no suppressor attached, but at this distance (she estimated a good few hundred metres, at least) the enemy wouldn't hear it. Hopefully. "Alright- the rest of you, keep moving. Four, stay with Six." DELTA-PRIME always spoke so matter-of-factly, she noticed. It was like she blocked out all of her other emotions, and focused on the current situation. Cisila wished she could do that...

Whatever. It didn't matter- Cisila got down on her stomach and crawled into the sniper position, and readied her rifle, placing it on its tripod. She had a pretty reasonable view of the warehouse the enemy was hiding in, put couldn't see the rest of the squad yet. Obviously, they were now rappeling down the cliffside, staying as quiet as possible. Ducain sat on a rock, crossing his legs. Cisila looked back at him, and though he couldn't see her face properly, she was scowling. "I keep telling her I don't need anyone to help." Ducain cocked his head to the side, "Yeah, and I know you don't. I'm not a spotter, anyway." Cisila rolled her eyes under her NVGs, "Then you should be going with them." Cisila turned back to the sniper rifle, and peered down the scope. She tried to adjust the scope, but couldn't seem to get it quite right. She muttered, "How far are we?" 

"About 550 metres." Huh? Cisila looked back. "Give or take a few." Ducain calmly said. "Uh...thanks?" She mumbled, turning, once more, back to the rifle. She adjusted it to the correct distance. Her radio came to life, and she heard DELTA-PRIME's voice in her ear,

"We're approaching the warehouse. Six, you got visual?"

Cisila peered down the scope once more, and couldn't see anything: "Negative. No visual. Switching to thermal." She flicked a switch on the scope, and pulled her NVGs up, turning them off. Looking through the thermal scope, she saw a sniper posted on a window, in the direction the rest of DELTA was heading. "Hang on- sniper. In the window." DELTA-PRIME responded, "Shit. Take 'em out." She breathed in slowly, gripping the pistol grip of the rifle, and holding the underbarrel with her other hand. *Target is somewhere between 540-550 metres.*  She aimed the scope a little higher, accounting for bullet drop. She couldn't feel any wind. She slowly pulled the trigger down. There was a click...and then the rifle boomed. The bullet flew right towards the target and went right through their head. Through the scope, she could see the sniper's rifle falling out of the window and into the ground below. "...Tango down." She felt her hands shaking. She hated staying still like this. She lifted the bolt and racked it. The casing flung out of the ejection port with a small *ping*, and collided with the rocks next to her, clattering to the ground.

She noticed she was sweating. Even at night, this place was strangely warm. 

"Six, think I spotted another one. East side."

Cisila turned the rifle to look at the east side. Sure enough, another soldier was peeking out of a window right above the back entrance- the one the squad was going to use. "Copy." She muttered. This one was closer, she observed, somewhere between 515-525 metres. This time, she felt some wind. It wasn't too strong, but she felt that it would put the bullet off course. She pressed down a button on her radio, and spoke. "Just a fair warning. I might miss. Some wind kicked in. Can someone get him if I miss?" DELTA-5 responded, "I gotcha." She saw, down on the ground, that Five was moving towards a set of shipping containers. There, he'd have a good opportunity to shoot the soldier if she missed.

"Ready?" She said. "Ready." Five responded.


She pulled the trigger. The rifle boomed once more, and the recoil hit her hard. The next second or so was agonizing. Suddenly- "Shit!" Five said over the radio, "You got him in the shoulder - he's moving back. Shit, shit!" Cisila held down the button on her radio again, "You need to move inside. If they catch us now, I don't think I'll be able to pick all you guys out from the bad guys."

The rest of the team, aside from Ducain, who was quietly sitting, cursed. DELTA-PRIME spoke up, "Six is right. Breach, ASAP. Going loud."

What? That's not what she meant. "No, don't go loud. Try to stay quiet as long as-"

DELTA-PRIME interrupted her. "We've got grenade launchers. We'll be fine." Cisila grumbled, "Fine."

She attached the C4 breach charge to the door and stepped back, raising a hand. "Take cover." She ducked around the corner, followed by DELTA-5 and DELTA-2, while DELTA-3 hung back in a different position. Alex pulled out the detonator, and pressed down the button. It clicked, and in a flash, the door blew off its hinges with a loud *bang*, and the four moved in. DELTA-5 went first, checking corners. Alex herself went next, following right behind Five. The warehouse was large, dingy, and filled with ship containers. Five went around a corner, and suddenly - he opened fire. The blinding muzzle flashes of his rifle illuminated the alley between the ship containers where they were moving, and Alex spotted a couple men moving back. She ducked between another set of ship containers, pulling down her NVGs and approaching the spot where the men were. She rounded the corner, and realized she was too close. She dropped her rifle (which flung back under her arm, as it was attached to a sling) pulled out her combat knife and cut through one of the men in one clean motion. The second man noticed her, and pulled out his pistol. Before he could even get a shot off, Alex lunged forward, and swiftly, she ripped apart the pistol in the man's hands, broke his arm and slammed him straight into the ground. She looked up, "Clear. Move on." 

She stared down at the man, and without any feeling of remorse, she unholstered her pistol and shot him through the head. The mission was to kill them all, of course, and that was what she was going to do. She motioned towards the rest of the squad to keep moving. They sweeped through the first floor of the warehouse, but found nothing. The soldiers must have booked it already and were outside. Alex switched on her radio, "Six, do you-" but she wasn't able to finish her sentence. She heard soldiers outside yell "SNIPER!" which was followed by the subtle *booms* of Six's sniper rifle. Two turned to Alex, grinding his teeth. "We need to get out of there. Six can't take them out alone." Five and Three nodded, and Alex grumbled. "Get a move on, then." She led the squad outside, and as soon as they got outside, she remembered something...

Six wouldn't be able to tell who was who. These American traitors had the same gear as them- Alex swore under her breath and stopped the squad. She flicked on her radio, "Six. For the love of God, please watch your fire. We're coming out."

Six responded, in her quiet mumble, "Roger that..." She seemed focus. That was the thing Alex liked about Six: when she was focused, she'd do her damn job. And she'd do it better than the one replaced, nine times out of ten. But whenever they were off duty, she'd shrink into the background. Alex wanted to wonder why, but it wasn't important, therefore, she ignored it. 

She lifted her rifle back up. "You boys know what to do. Let's get this over with and get the hell outta here." Deltas Two, Three and Five all nodded. They rushed towards the group of traitors, who were running for it. Alex thought they had hidden their vehicles somewhere, and were running for them. They wouldn't get there. She held down the trigger of her rifle and emptied the magazine in the general direction of the running men. The muzzle of her rifle illuminated the path they were following every time it flashed after a shot. They were following a small dirt path towards a smaller warehouse - it must be where they keep their vehicles, she thought. But before she could even think of stopping them...

A large, dual-propellered helicopter flew over them- she'd somehow not heard it until just now. Her eyes went wide under her NVGs as she saw a large machine gun stapled to the side of the helicopter swivel towards them, and she yelled "GET DOWN!"

Cisila swore under her breath. That helicopter would take the rest of them out, if it could find them. She'd completely lost the rest of the squad as they dove into the brush, and they'd be safe for at least a couple of minutes. Behind her, she heard Ducain get up and approach her. "I might have something that can stop that chopper." He said, seeming straight to the point. She turned to look at him, and lifted her NVGs. "Unless you've got an RPG up your sleeve, nothing's taking that down." She turned away after she said this, and heard him pull something out of his vest. She decided not to pay attention, and instead kept her scope trained on the second warehouse. The soldiers had gotten inside, but for some reason hadn't left yet. Something clicked behind her...it must be Ducain, she thought. The hell was he doing? And then another click. And then suddenly...the helicopter burst into flames. She looked up in shock - the flames were as bright as the sun in the pitch black of this abandoned desert.

She racked the bolt of her rifle once more as she noticed the soldiers, equally as shocked, peered out of the building. Like DELTA-PRIME said, the mission was why they were here. She begin firing on the warehouse, hitting a soldier every now and then. In the middle of this, her radio sputtered and crackled with various "Got him!" and "Outta the way!" from the other squad members- when suddenly, she heard a yell through the radio. Looking through her scope, she saw Five on the ground, writhing with pain while a set of soldiers approached him, rifles raised. It seemed like they intended to take him hostage. Her brain worked faster than normal, and she felt her hands move the rifle carefully. She pulled the trigger, felt the rifle recoil, and then watched one of the soldiers fall to the ground. She almost felt as if she was moving in slow motion, and each soldier fell over like a bowling pin after each shot. She flicked on her radio, "Five is down. Someone get him!" She said more audibly than usual - and through the scope she saw Three run up, latch onto Five, and drag him into cover. 

She stopped looking through her scope and looked up at the chopper- it was whirling around like it was in a tornado, invisible forces seeming to push it. It continued to whirl around, spinning closer and closer to the warehouse, which was being lit by the flames engulfing the chopper. Its blades suddenly stopped spinning and it plummeted towards the shed like a heavy dumbbell. She heard DELTA-PRIME over the radio yell, "RUN!" but had no idea if they had time to when-

The helicopter made impact with the warehouse, and both exploded into flames. In the light, she could see the enemy running into the desert, but she knew she wouldn't be able to hit them. She knew that, unfortunately, they'd failed. She looked back at Ducain, and immediately lashed at him. "What the hell was THAT? Was that YOU?!" Ducain looked taken aback for a moment. "I thought it'd help...I suppose it didn't." Cisila rolled her eyes, "Yeah, sure, set a chopper on fire with some magic or whatever. Kill the pilot and send him straight AT OUR OWN SQUAD." She punched the ground, sending sand everywhere. "You also let the enemy escape. You absolute-" Ducain held up a hand to stop her. He sighed, then remarked, "There's nothing I can do about it. I thought it would crash somewhere else." Cisila grumbled, and heaved herself up. She slung the TAC-338 over her shoulder, and flicked on her radio. "Alex, we need evac. We failed." There was a momentary silence in the darkness. Cisila wondered for a moment if Kellien had died in the explosion, and if- the radio crackled, and to her relief, she got a response: "I know. Command's going to put us on something really bad because of this." Cisila nodded, though she knew only Ducain could see her. 

The only thing to do now was to wait for evac to arrive.

She shook her head. They hadn't had any orders from anyone over the past week and a half since the mission, so if there was going to be anyone yelling at them, it'd probably be today. And just on cue, her phone blipped with a text message from Kellien. She picked up her phone and read the message,

*General wants us down in his office. Not good.*

Not good was right. Cisila got up from her chair, shoved her phone into a pocket, and quickly left her room. She walked down a few hallways, descended a set of stairwells that went much deeper into the base, and eventually found herself at the door to General Rockwell's office. She knocked, and got a solemn "Come in." from the General inside. She took hold of the knob, turned it and pushed the door open slowly. It didn't creak, she noticed, as it usually did. She took a step forward and shut the door quietly behind her, and when she looked up, she saw all the squad standing awkwardly in front of Rockwell's desk. She sidled in next to Three and Five, who was still bandaged up from his wounds. Five looked pretty grizzly (his beard was really quite bushy), but was quite soft in actuality. He had this sad dog look to him at the moment, as he eyed the general. Three was short, clean-shaven, and reminded her of someone she'd seen before, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. 

She was snapped back into the moment when the general first spoke, "Alright...let's get this over." He dropped a pen on his desk, and it clattered along the wood and almost rolled off the edge. "You failed. I don't like saying that. But this is inexcusable. The amount of times you've finished a mission more difficult than this is astounding. Why is this the first one you've failed?" *And how are you still alive,* she guessed he was thinking. Rockwell clasped his hands together, "Lucky for you, command's got something that requires your...expertise." He eyed each of them, his grey eyes scanning their faces. He was old, but looked rather decent for his age. A short beard encompassed the lower part of his face, while his hair, however unstylish it was, was in an unkempt mullet. His eyes landed on Cisila, "Specially you, girl." Cisila returned his stare, reluctantly. He looked away and addressed Kellien, "We've got a big problem. One of our largest military bases is under siege by...someone..." his eyes flicked towards Cisila again, "with Enhancements from PALMER-EDEN, or so we think. He took over the base within an hour, cutting off all communication and endangering the surrounding area." Kellien stepped forward, "Sir, what does this man have as abilities?" Cisila knew that Kellien had abilities like she did, but she still got taken aback every time she mentioned it. Kellien never seemed like she needed or used her abilities, even with the band that suppressed them off.

Rockwell sighed, "He seems to be able to create living organisms from nothing." Cisila's eyes went wide for a few moments, and it was like the floor dropped out from under her. She'd seen someone with the ability to smash a human together from other human parts (Mikhail, her mind remembered) but never one that could CREATE one. Her head went dizzy for a moment, realizing this was basically her ability, but focused on making living beings. She shook her head and grounded herself in the moment again, remembering not to keep doing that. "In addition," The general grumbled, "Seems like he can turn personnel into zombies or whatever. We estimate he's got about half the base...infected, if you will." Kellien shook her head, "And what's our mission? Kill him?" Rockwell stared at her for a moment, as if going through the things he could say. *Your mission is to throw yourselves off a cliff,* Cisila thought. That's what it always was. "Yes...your mission is to kill him, and make sure the base doesn't get razed. We're sending in a whole ton of the army aswell, to retrieve data and take out as many of these infected people as possible. But your mission...again...is to kill him." From his tone, Cisila could tell he didn't think he'd be seeing them again after they left. "When...do we leave?" Cisila mumbled. Better to get it over with. Kellien raised an eyebrow at her. Cisila shook her head.

Rockwell grumbled, "Welp, since you're asking...you might as well go now. Get the hell outta my office and to your designated VTOL." The squad nodded, and left. Cisila was the last to the door when the general grunted at her. She looked back, with a confused look on her face. "Give that motherfucker hell, alright girl?" Cisila raised an eyebrow at him, then said, "...Sir, yes sir." She left, shutting the door behind her.

And within the hour, they were climbing into their VTOL in full military gear. They'd arrive around midnight, so they had their NVGs on once again, ready to be flipped down in a moment's notice. Kellien had also ordered Cisila to bring a crowbar and entry tools, so her backpack was full of them, along with the extra ammo magazines and backup backup pistol she had. Her usual pistol of choice, the SOCOM MK.23, was holstered in her dropleg holster. It was an old gun, and not one she was supposed to have, but she couldn't be bothered to use a newer one. She had also swapped out her sniper rifle for a much more blunt Benelli M1014 shotgun, as from the plans they were given, the squad knew they'd be indoors much more than outside, so having a sniper rifle wasn't exactly smart. As she climbed into the VTOL, she made sure she had everything else she needed on her combat vest. Knife, check. Radio, check. All the ammo pouches...of course. Her helmet was on properly, everything was connected. She took a seat next to Kellien and strapped herself in.

"This is a big one, Six." Kellien said. Cisila nodded, "I really don't think we're getting out of this one." 

"No," Kellien shook her head, "We will."
The VTOL erupted to life, and the rotors began to spin. She looked around at the rest of the squad, who were fiddling with their vests to try and make the seatbelts more comfortable.

And suddenly, they lifted off into the sky, and were flying towards Nevada.
She tried to lean out to one of the open doors to get a look at the base as they were flying away, but she couldn't see it in the darkness.

*Not like it was home anyways.*

He was sitting in the floor in a dark room, messing with a glob of *something* that he'd made. 

It was important to make sure the personnel he'd infected would stay that way, and it seemed like this would do it. An organism with a few legs, an eye, that'd do it. It just needed to latch onto the person's chest and find their heart. Then it would be under control. Not even the military would stop him at this rate, no matter how hard they tried. He put the glob down (he really should name some of these things) and watched it skitter into a nearby vent, sliding through the grates like they were nothing.

There was only one way this would end, he knew, and now that he couldn't kill Palmer (at least somebody had done it...) he'd go straight to the top. The entire government was at fault, of course. Not to mention the fact that they smothered out any news concerning these "superpowered people" they called them. Any mention was reduced to, "they're just humane experiments". But that was wrong. Oh, that was so incredibly wrong. He got up, limped over to a computer, and searched through it. *Where was it...* He thought to himself. He opened a file containing every U.S citizen reported to have powers. He scrolled through them slowly, and noted down that most of them were deceased. Most of them, in fact, had been enlisted. Into a classified squad system built to kill Enhanced people by throwing them into combat without any experience. He also knew that there were only three of those teams left...two were new, but one...one was strange. One had succeeded at almost every mission they had done, like they had actual military experience. The missions were still suicide, but they made it out. He wondered if they'd send this strange squad after them. He snorted to himself, *And then what? Throw them in the sea?* 

Perhaps he could convince the squad to help him. They'd understand...at least one of them had to be an experiment done by Palmer, right? It was statistically likely...there had to be one. *There could be someone here that has the other half of this ability...the non-living one.*

He flexed his arms. He could feel the strange fleshy part of his abilities residing under his muscles. He wondered what it would be like to have the other ability. To be able to create weapons out of thin air...if that was one of these people, he'd convince them. He always did. And if they didn't agree...well, he couldn't turn them into a zombie. That sapped any of their abilities out. 

But there was absolutely no way they'd blindly follow the military. There was *no* way they wouldn't want to help, he knew this. They wanted to use their powers freely, obviously, and he would *give* them that. 

*But what if they're here to kill you? What if they don't care?* A corner of his mind whispered.

He crossed his arms and stared at DELTA squad's dataset. He'd just have to kill them. Easy enough.

It had taken a while, but they had finally entered Nevada. Cisila swore the sound of the rotors wasn't even there anymore, just bouncing around in her skull like an annoying bug. Through the darkness, she had spotted other VTOLs flying next to them. She always wondered why the army was using VTOLs. They were slow, and these particular models were inefficient. She guessed it made paratroopers' jobs easier, but that didn't really seem like a good reason. Whatever. She shook her head to herself, and looked around the VTOL.

The plan was to drop out of it - they had parachutes on. She wasn't exactly sure how this was a good idea, but then again, landing and disembarking was worse, probably. If the general was telling the truth, then hundreds of zombie-things would probably be waiting for them the moment they landed. Dropping onto a roof and getting inside was quieter. Easier, probably. The hard part was jumping out. She *hated* jumping out of a moving object. But there wasn't exactly another option, she told herself. She breathed in slowly, and breathed out. Kellien seemed to catch Cisila's anxiousness rising, and nudged her shoulder. "You'll be fine. Even if something goes wrong, I know I can trust you to dig yourself out of it." Cisila nodded, and cracked a rare smile. Kellien always had a way of cheering everybody up, even if she was scary sometimes. Their radios suddenly sputtered to life, and the pilot said, "We're almost at the LZ. Reminder to get ready in about...five." Everybody nodded, but didn't get up. Then, the pilot continued, "Try to land on the- huh?" He paused for a moment. "Oh, for the love of-" then one of the other VTOLs that Cisila could see out of the side burst into flame. 

Kellien sighed, strangely unconcerned. "Great." She muttered. The pilot spoke once more, "Looks like our zombie friends got hold of some jets. I've no idea why I'm so calm about this, but hold on to your horses." Cisila was glad to hear that the pilot felt calm aswell. Something was...incredibly off. It felt like the air was calm, everything was calm...which it obviously SHOULDN'T BE, her head yelled at her. So WHY was she so calm? "Shit...okay...missile inbound - releasing flares." Then there was a pause.

"The- the button's stuck."

Kellien swore loudly, and tried to get up. It seemed like she was fighting the calmness, but it didn't work. She leaned back dejectedly, seeming to accept that they were about to get shot down. Cisila couldn't think clearly, it felt like her mind was trying to wade through a bog. 

And then suddenly, the missile hit. She missed what happened next, but she felt the VTOL spin uncontrollably and then...stop. And then it went dark for a few moments.


Then there was a creak. A snap. And the strangest sound of dripping. Her eyes flicked open. She was lying sideways. Her mind immediately kicked into gear - the calmness had disappeared. She struggled to get the seatbelt off, and climbed up. Nobody else was in the VTOL except...she gasped. Five was still in his seat, hanging from the other side of the VTOL, now the ceiling. A large piece of shrapnel had pierced right where his biggest wound from Africa was. She flicked on her radio, but found that it wasn't working. It seemed to have gotten hit by something in the crash. She tugged it off her vest and reluctantly looked up at Five's body, where his radio was still attached. She reached up and tore it off his vest. She shook her head, and couldn't bear to look at Five's corpse any longer. She turned away, and felt the VTOL creak under her feet. She realized a couple things: one, light was shining through the VTOL's doors. It was the morning. How long had she been out for? Why had Kellien not taken her? Two...the VTOL was balancing on the cliffside. Her heartrate immediately spiked, *IhavetogetoutIhavetogetoutIhavetogetout*, her mind started repeating. She clambered towards the doors facing the cliffside as the VTOL lurched to the side. 

She felt her boots lose grip as the aircraft slipped off the cliff. Without a second thought, she leaped out and landed on a small outcropping on the cliffs. And, with immense sadness, she heard the VTOL crash and explode below. That was Five gone...assuming the rest weren't dead. She sat up and leaned against the rough orange rocks that made up the cliff. Here, the intense sunlight burned down on her, and she realized she'd been cut a few times. The most notable one went right across her nose, and it was a miracle it didn't injure her eye. She felt through her vest and couldn't find any bandages or a sewing kit, so she couldn't close the wound for the time being.

For now, she'd have to scale the cliff. Luckily for her, they usually carried rappelling gear for situations like this. She pulled her backpack off and rummaged through it, pulling out the grapple gun she had. She pulled her bag back on, and got up. She felt the rocks crunch under her combat boots as she moved carefully towards the least rocky place to climb up. She scanned the top of the cliffs (She noted that it looked very far away...) and held up the grapple gun. Pulling the trigger, she felt a small click and heard the rope *thwip* out of the gun, and watched it go all the way up and hook onto something at the very top. She sighed. Thank God there was something up there. She attached the rope to her vest and heaved herself up. Putting her feet against the rocks as she climbed gave her more stability, and used less of her energy. Slowly, it became more like an exercise, and she forgot where she was. Cisila looked back out at where the VTOL fell, and remembered the time her father took her rock climbing. She was 12.
