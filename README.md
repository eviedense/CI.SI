# Hi.

This is a collection of my writing for my writing project. You can find Parts 1, 2, and 3 along with some extra content here. Check EXTRA for INTERIM, DESOLATION Cisila's NOIR video game idea, and find Parts Extra 1 and 2, Contract Killer, and Kasey's "Blurred" in WRITING, in the same place as Parts 1, 2, and 3. 

Check MISC INFO for other extra stuff that doesn't quite count as proper writing, including a full bio on the main character and her different versions. 

# The Point?

The point of this is just to have fun, and I don't really take this as a serious writing thing. Ideas come, ideas work, and they get written down.

# The Story

The story follows a girl named Cisila Jane Siveta, who is twenty four. Both of her parents died, but not together. Her father died in a military conflict, while her mother was shot in front of her. Cisila desperately wants revenge against the one who ordered her mom killed. As her mother was a scientist and project leader for pharmaceutical company PALMER-EDEN, and was trying to expose something that PALMER-EDEN was doing, she was killed. This "something" Cisila had been affected by, giving her something akin to super powers. Understanding what to do, Cisila leaves her childhood home alone, and goes to Chicago. Cue the rest of the plot.

There are a lot of characters in the story (or will be in the story as of the time of writing this) so a README can't really cover all of them, but here is a quick list:

Cisila Jane Siveta - Main Character/Protagonist, biggest arc (obviously)

Lyla Silvermann - Deuteragonist, Love Interest

Dani Joserte - Secondary Character, kind of a "mentor figure", one of the leaders of a mysterious group

Kasey - Secondary Character, Best Friends with Cisila

Zephyr - Secondary Character, affiliated with Dani

Mikhail Reznov - First antagonist, former love interest

Adam - Second antagonist, acts as a Garden of Eden metaphor

Martin Palmer - Main antagonist, gives Cisila her powers, acts as the final boss of everything - CEO of PALMER-EDEN
