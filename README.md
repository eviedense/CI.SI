# So What The Heck Is This?

Cisila Jane Siveta, twenty four, is a normal person during the day- and a vigilante at night. She is Chicago's Batman. She, to the criminal underworld, is fear itself. Cisila works alone, though is sometimes forced to work alongside a cult-like organization that rescued her from the edge of life.
She tries to do everything she can to get back at the ones who ruined her life. The ones who forced her along this path. *PALMER-EDEN,* a strange pharmaceutical company dabbling in the confusing ethics of super-powered humans.

By day, she works at a library- alone. She tries to ignore her coworkers, but eventually, she just can't. Someone likes her, and she likes them back.

By night, she dons a strange mask with an ominous aura, and uses her ability **EXO** and **Construct** to investigate the criminal underworld hiding in Chicago.

# Writing

My (kind of sucky) writing is featured in here, shown through PART 1, PART 2, PART 3, INTERIM - 2088, and REIGN. These main stories follow Cisila's journey to become not a hero, but a journey to survive. Not everything is black and white, especially not the glorious United States of America.

# Lore

There's lots of this. From the main detailed story of Cisila, to random whatever conversations where characters discuss important things, to alternate universes where something went wrong. 

# Music? What?

In the actual written PART 1, 3, and INTERIM, you can find Spotify links to music. I use music far, far too much as a source for the general vibe. It also helps me think and create scenes.
