# Everything Else I Couldn't Put In The Synopses

Part 0: A prologue. The one where she leaves Chicago after her mother's death and takes up a position as a fire lookout in the middle of nowhere. Also where she discovers her powers.
She pursues a mysterious murderer going through the park and killing campers & hikers, with not much left behind. 

Part 4: Kind of an epilogue? Not really. This is the last one, where Cisila attempts to confront her mental health problems with her therapist (who is a side character I forgot to mention).
However, the treatment they plan out...isn't exactly natural. The therapist seems to know what he's doing, however, and Cisila trusts him. 

Yeah, so like, she's dropped into a dimension created by her mind. It's basically a far-future version of Chicago, right after a post-apocalypse. There's not that many people left.
Can you tell I don't have much for this yet? It's a concept still. I'll add more here when I get more.
