 SUBJECT-27, Aged 24, currently in employment at Little Panama Library, born to Elias (Deceased) & Alcina (Deceased) Siveta. Subject's father was part of military personnel, holding the Second Lieutenant rank in the U.S Marine corps.
Subject's mother was a scientist at PALMER-EDEN Labs, located in Chicago. Both deceased - subject has been left an orphan since age 19. Subject's father died in the middle of a civil conflict on American soil, and his body has not been found.
The mother reported that her husband would quote unquote 'train' the subject via his military experience before his death. Close-quarters combat + some minor weapons training (likely handguns to rifles) were all the subject was taught. 
Training reportedly started when the subject was in her teenage years, and clearly was not done when the father passed away. 

Subject's mother, however, worked at PALMER-EDEN as a high-level scientist. Details cannot be given on the work she had done for the company, but upon her refusing to hand in her most recent work of the time, stating moral obligations. 
Subject, aged 19, was subsequently taken.
This, obviously, seems to have been some kind of questionably ethical thing to do. Details on what was done to SUBJECT-27 cannot and will not be mentioned here, but the subject was released afterwards, alive. 
The same cannot be said for the subject's mother. Continuing to refuse to hand in the on-going work, she was 'terminated' (that is to say, killed) when she stated she would release details on the experiments conducted on SUBJECTS 1-26.
This, of course, is not good. While the CEO maintains a positive stance on the actions taken, he also realized that this could not happen again. Thus, PALMER-EDEN opened their own private military company to keep an eye on the company's HQ, and Chicago.
This is where this file will be sent upon completion, with major edits to be done to various details that I, the first draft writer, have said.

By the time SUBJECT-27 was released, she was already (somehow) rather financially independent of her parents. However, the subject was still living with them. Upon their deaths, the house was foreclosed. 
On the day of the foreclosure, SUBJECT-27 disappears off the radar for a considerable amount of time. 5 months after subject's disappearance, she returns. Now aged 20, she seems to understand what happened to her. Unfortunately for PALMER-EDEN,
this means there is a possibility she had realized what the experiment had done to her. This file is being created as a means to look at data concerning SUBJECT-27 for personnel if (or when) the time comes that she poses a threat to the company. 

Personal details:
Subject has no friend group, at least from observations. Though, she is seen interacting quite a lot at her workplace, a library. Her daily life comprises of

Hi. If you're reading this, they've left out a lot. I was going through data on their server, and found this half-assed file on Cisila. I'll leave the original work alone - seeing as that information is accurate - but I thought I'd fill in the gaps.
First of all, Cisila was subjected to a kind of secret government project that PALMER-EDEN was carrying out. It's classified information, but some humans have an extra 'organ' that gives them something akin to super powers. It changes from person to person,
but...Cisila didn't have any. The project was to give someone these powers (after killing someone else to extract the organ) and release them to see what they'd do with it. To see if it worked, or if it'd kill them immediately. The only thing that this file mentions
is that her mom was killed, seemingly because they took Cisila. That's wrong. She refused to cooperate, and they shot her. Then, the boss decided, "hey, let's use this little runt for our questionably ethical experiment". 

Real slick. Y'know, murder someone's mom, take them, torture them, and then kick them out. Yeah, that's definitely not gonna cause a problem.
Anyway- Cisila left Illinois after this, just to get out of Chicago. She took up a spot out in the middle of nowhere, as a fire lookout. Doesn't matter where she was specifically, but it's where she figured out how to use her abilities.
She's got this kind of...ability where she can create things from thin air in her hands. If, and only if, she understands how the material is made. I'm talking chemically. She's got to study the molecular structure of whatever she wants to construct,
but after she understands it- bam. She can construct whatever the hell she wants. Like, a pistol.

But, the ability only works when her EXOskeleton is active. This is the physical part of her powers, and it's kind of like the skeleton of, like, an Iron Man suit. Y'know, that movie guy. She just...can't fly around. She can fall pretty damn far, though.
The only thing that sticks out when she's not in her EXO-mode is her right eye. That's the one she covers with her hair. It...well, it looks unnatural. Like a robot plucked out her normal eye and shoves its own into it, replete with a pair of wires sticking out.
Poor girl only figured all this out when she was on death's door, trying to rescue someone in the wilderness. I still don't know how she survived.

When she came back, she decided she wanted to get back at PALMER-EDEN, and...well, she obviously started doing so. Sabotaging any ongoing projects outside of the lab, while concealing her identity with this creepy-ass mask. We call her 'V'.
I work with her sometimes, but our work isn't that similar. I only help her because my parents knew hers.

[And there's a few more words, but they seem to be in some kind of strange language in a different typeface that is indecipherable.]
