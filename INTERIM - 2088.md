The first thing I ever remember...was waking up. There was nothing before that. At least, that's what I was always told - but I'm not sure I believe them. Not that it matters, because if I push myself to try and remember whatever "before" was, nothing comes. I look down at my arms, and instead of seeing what I *should* see...I see metal arms attached to what was left of my own. I flex my fingers, but I don't feel anything...yet, I can feel it hurt. I raise one of my hands to my right eye, and touch the metal apparatus that replaced my eye. It's wrong. It was all wrong, but how on Earth did I know that? With whatever happened before erased, I don't know where this feeling comes from. It must be deeply engrained in my brain, or something.

I got up from my bed and paced around my room - stark white walls, sheets, everything. It was as bland as possible to keep me focused on the things that were actually important. No books, paintings...nothing. Distractions were nowhere to be seen. I shook my scraggy dark brown hair out of my face (I needed to shower...) and started pulling my uniform on. I slung my satchel over my shoulder, pulled my utility belt on over my uniform. I walked over to the windows, where the blinders were shut. I sighed, and muttered "Windows open." The AI in the walls complied, and the blinders slid up into their little cache, where they hid until I decide to call them down again. As they slid away, the light hit my eye. *Bright and early,* I thought. The sun shined over Prague, and she could see all of it from this high up - a giant skyscraper, bigger than every other building, towered over the city. *Czechia,* I put my hand on the window. *My home. Right?* I supposed it was. But something about it didn't feel right...

The announcement system blared to life, and I immediately turned my attention to it. It was slightly crackly (must've been old tech...) but I recognized the voice. "Codename GRADIENT, please report to Level Ten- Palmer needs you." I felt my lip twitch. Palmer- that man...I shook my head and turned away from the golden sky, and left my room. I headed down the hallway towards an elevator (the hallway was as bland as everything else...) As I got to the elevator, I pressed a button to call it. Standing there for a few seconds, I watched the display above the elevator doors count up from G...the ground floor. It ticked up slowly before it got to my level - the twenty-first level. There was a small *ding* and the elevator doors opened. I stepped into the small, circular elevator and pressed the button to the tenth floor. It started to descend...

The elevator had a giant glass window looking out on the rest of Prague - it was beautiful, but eerie. The city was strangely quiet, and I couldn't see anyone down in the streets. I rubbed my eye (it hurt.) and blinked. I heard another *ding,* and the doors behind me opened. I turned around, and stepped out onto the tenth level. It was much larger and slightly less bland than my own level, with a large fountain in the centre, and some flora dotted around. It was still *weirdly* clean...I walked around the fountain and headed towards Palmer's office. I passed a couple of people I knew, but didn't feel like greeting them. I entered Palmer's office after a couple minutes of walking, but he was nowhere to be seen. I crossed my arms, and looked around the office- it was the only cluttered room in the tower, probably. Papers littered the floor, his desk was cluttered with books, binders, and a couple of laptops. I tilted my head as I spotted the laptop, *those are old...* I shuffled up to his desk and picked up one of the laptops. *This is at least a few decades old...why does he have this?* On the back of the laptop, there were a lot of stickers that had been put on it. They seemed familiar, but I really couldn't put my finger on it.

No, really, I couldn't. I wasn't able to feel them. They were mostly cute, purple stickers - and even a strange flag that had seven lines, going from orange to pink. Huh. I shook my head and put it down, *probably used to be his or something - keeps it around for the data.*

I sat down in a squishy armchair in the corner of the room, and continued to wait. It was dead silent - I could clearly hear buzzing in my ears. The only sound that pierced my ears was the ticking of an old clock on the wall, across the room. I stared at it. I wished it would stop. The relentless tick, tock, tick, tock that was the passing of time. I eventually gave up and began to stare into space - my head completely blank. Ever since I had woken up, I was never able to see anything in my head. Had I tried (and I definitely did) nothing would happen. I only had a voice in my head, and even that felt wrong. Like it wasn't mine. 

I blinked, and suddenly...an hour passed. I jolted up right, realizing I'd fallen asleep (did I get enough sleep last night?) and got up from the chair. Palmer was sitting at his desk, his scraggly, twirling hair running down the sides of his head and his glasses made him immediately recognizable. "Sir-" I began, but I was stopped when Palmer raised his hand, and interrupted me. "I didn't want to wake you up, you looked comfortable." He spoke in his usual quiet mumble. I crossed my arms, "But you-" Palmer snapped his fingers. "No. It wasn't urgent. Sit down, and I can tell you about it now." I heeded his words, and sat in the less comfortable armchair directly in front of Palmer's desk. 

He linked his fingers together and began to ramble. "Last night, at about...11PM, let's say, some of our security spotted a group of Outsiders moving through the city. They had to have taken down some of the perimeter security, because the west cameras were offline, and so were our motion detectors. They disappeared about an hour later, and we haven't been able to find them." I tilted my head, "Outsiders? You mean those freaks who live in the wilderness? What are they doing in Praha?" Palmer shook his head, "That I don't know. What I *do* know, though," he leaned back and gestured at me, "is that you can find them. I'd like you to go out today and follow their trail - from the perimeter to their last known location. You're one of our best recon Tecs in the field, and I'd trust you to do worse." I nodded- of course I'd be the one doing this. Palmer continued, "Of course," he pushed his glasses back up his nose indigninantly, "I'll have a RAC pick you up and fly you to the perimeter. I don't want to make you walk." I shifted in my chair uncomfortably...did he feel the uneasiness down in the streets? "Right," I began, "it'll probably take a couple of days to track them down, and you haven't said whether I'm supposed to engage them or not."

Palmer shook his head, "Don't engage them when you find them. I want to figure out what they're doing here, and where they live. Those Outsiders have been a-" He paused to think about his next words carefully, "...pain, as of recent times. I'm beginning to lose sympathy for them..." He flicked a hand towards his desk, and a holographic monitor appeared, floating above his desk, and he scanned it with his eyes. "Yeah, west cams are still out. You better start there. I'm calling a RAC now, so get your gear on and head out to the courtyard when you're ready." He smiled a small bit, and I took that as a sign to leave. Getting up from my chair, I headed towards the door and reached for the handles. "Oh, and-" He sputtered suddenly, "R&D finally finished that CFI-3 blade you requested. It's with your gear." I looked back and nodded. Took them long enough. I pushed the doors open and exited his office, but immediately ran into someone else.

Captain Kellien (that name always sounded familiar...) greeted me. He stood tall, and looked as though he had been through everything. Only difference was...he had no cybernetics. He was pure skill. "Had a talk with the big man again?" He asked. "Yeah," I nodded. "Outsiders got in. Told me to go track them down." Kellien snorted, "Have fun. I had to go out a couple months ago to get someone back that they'd kidnapped once, y'know." I began to walk, and he followed. "Who'd they take?" I asked. Kellien sighed, "One of the R&D boys. Dunno how they got in with their ancient gear, but they took 'im." Kellien and I descended a set of stairs and entered the equipment room. "You...coming or something?" I asked. He shook his head, "Got something else to do today." He walked over to a set of lockers labelled "WILDERNESS GEAR", and began pulling various parts out. I realized he was heading past the perimeter, and as I began to gear up, I asked him why. 

"Kellien...you're heading PTP?" PTP. Stood for *Past The Perimeter.* The perimeter was such a big deal that we had abbreviations like that- most citizens never left Prague these days, and those who did were wealthier than most. Going on business trips to England or what have you. Kellien shook his head, "Yes and no. Palmer's got me doing something with a squad. I-" he paused, "I can't tell you." He pulled out a large, bulky helmet with an obvious respirator attached. It would cover someone's entire head, with even their visor being opaque. I realized where he was going.

"...You're leaving the country?" That was gear for surviving radiated areas. And there was only one serious enough to warrant gear *that* serious.

France.

I felt shocked. Why was Palmer sending people to *FRANCE?* You know, that radiated wasteland? There was nothing left there.  Kellien slowly nodded, "Mhm. Seems like you figured it out." I attached my new CFI-3 blade in its sheathe to my utility belt, "Well it's- it's whatever." I mumbled. "Palmer knows what he's doing, right? It's probably important." I was lying through my teeth. Palmer knew France was a death trap. He wouldn't waste his best soldiers on a place like that... *No, wait,* my head argued. *He's not wasting them...there HAS to be something important there worth sending someone like Kellien.* That was true, I argued with myself, but it was ridiculous nonetheless.

Kellien pulled his gear on without any other words, and left the equipment room. I knew I probably wouldn't see him again. I picked up the rest of my gear, and pulled it on. I shoved my standard issue Tecs pistol into its holster and tested my wristblades. They shot out of my wrists and extended far past my hands with a quiet *thunk.* They were sharpened so much that even the smallest grazing would cut deep - and the cut would burn like hell. I stared at them, contemplating if I'd have to use them, and let them slide back into my arms. The arms I had on...they were stuck to me, like a leech. I raised them up and stared at them. Sleek black metal interlaced with carbon fibre, with orange metal parts scattered around important areas of the arm to keep it protected. I could see the mechanical muscles underneath the arm move when I moved it, but it still didn't feel right. I knew I was *supposed* to be able to feel what my arms touched, but it never worked. I walked towards the same door that Kellien had left through and jogged down a set of stairs that went to another elevator - a much older, dingier elevator that was used for service. I stepped in and pressed the "G" button. The elevator creaked and began to descend. 

The speakers warbled slightly, emitting crackles and pops. I looked up at the speakers, and realized they were trying to play elevator music. *Really? Weird.* The elevator hit the floor and stopped as it *dinged* to tell me it got to the ground floor. The doors weakly opened, and I stepped through them. I walked out into the lobby, a nice, peaceful area with an even bigger fountain than Level Ten. It was more colorful down here, as there was a food court here for any employees who actually lived here *(Like myself...)* . I walked towards the back exit, and out into the concrete courtyard behind the tower. A large RAC sat there. RAC stood for Recon Assault Chopper - they were a class of models, rather than a single one. The one waiting for her was a VTOL model with two side doors and miniguns bolted to the side in case they needed to engage something. The pilot, who I could see in the cockpit, waved at me. I feebly waved back and climbed into the RAC. 

I shut the one of the doors and leaned out one of the others as the chopper took off, ascending above Prague. Closer to the city, I could spot the messy makeshift homes built on top of the original buildings and that had squeezed themselves into the tiny alleyways between buildings. Again, I couldn't see anyone. Nobody liked going outside - not even for shopping. Shopping physically had become limited to antique shops, who refused to sell their things online (for whatever reason...) and thus, most people considered physical shopping an antique itself. As it continued to fly over the city, I managed to spot a few abandoned buildings that I knew would be *excellent* hiding spots for the Outsiders, had they actually decided to stay. There was a large building that used to be a bank and had some of the most secure...security (*ugh,* she thought) in the city. It, ironically, had gone bankrupt due to their security faltering to new means of data breaching and theft. 

Another building I could spot on the edge of the river was an old apartment complex, that had been the victim of a vicious firebombing (*Probably by the Outsiders,* her mind rambled.) and hadn't been reconstructed, because practically nobody lived there. The only person I knew that lived there was my sister, but that memory didn't seem quite right - fuzzy around the edges. I pushed that thought out- not that my sister mattered at all. The RAC finally flew over the Perimeter and landed just outside the East Gates where Palmer had told me that the Outsiders had managed to get in from. I hopped out of the chopper, signalled to the pilot to leave, and walked towards the Gates. I hated being outside the Perimeter because of how many *things* were out here. Rabid wolves could burst out of the trees at any moment, or a mutated Whatever-the-Fuck could crush me under its foot. Getting to the Gate, I immediately saw what Palmer meant - it looks like the cameras had been shot down. There were burn marks on the metal arm that held one of the cameras, and in a ditch, I spotted the missing camera. Heading towards the ditch, I picked the camera up. *No saving this one,* I realized. Its lense had been shattered and it looks like the internals had melted. I haphazardly threw it back into the ditch and looked around. The sky had turned cloudy grey, and looked like it might rain. *That means I'll lose any tracks,* I walked back towards the spot that the camera arm was, and looked down at the ground. There, I could see various footprints. Two sets, specifically, I thought. One was a pair of combat boots that, from the soleprints, looked worn. The other was a slightly different set of boots, that I guessed were hiking boots. The soleprints followed the wall down, away from the Gate. So they hadn't entered through the gate. Good, I thought. That meant they were still working. Instead, I followed the footprints until I finally found how they got in.

Looking at the wall, a thick white-grey concrete mass with electrical fences held up against it, I spotted a large hole in the bottom. I crouched next to it and stared at it, confused. *How did nobody catch this?* Oh- right. The cameras had gone out. That means the Outsiders had had all the time in the world to set this up - I looked at it closer and saw the remains of an explosive charge. Picking it up and turning it over in my hands, I concluded what they'd done. They snuck up to the cameras (I knew they had blind spots, so this wasn't out of the question) broke them, and blew up a part of the wall. Since the Perimeter was a decent distance from the actual city, and nobody guarded it, it was basically free reign. I ducked down and crawled through the hole, and once I was out, I spotted the footprints once more. Looking up, I realized they must have just *walked* to the city. How had nobody caught them? *Doesn't matter. YOU stop them.* Her mind said to me. What? Huh? I shook my head and followed the trail back towards Prague.

As soon as I entered the outskirts, I lost track of the footprints. Of course it wasn't going to be THAT easy. I stopped and leaned against the wall of a shack, sighing. Then I remembered something. *My eye!* My hand immediately jerked up to the cybernetic *thing* stuck into her face where her right eye used to be. I blinked. Her? Who's her? *Me.* My head mumbled. I backtracked to the footprints and scanned the set of footprints made by the combat boots with the cybernetic eye (it wasn't fair to call it an eye, it was more like a hunk of metal) and I pressed down a switch on one of my arms - I immediately felt my real eye burn as my vision switched from normal human vision to a strange melding of thermal vision. I could see the set of combat boots through the miriad of other footprints. Grinning, I began to follow them deeper into the city. I had been walking for a good hour when the prints finally stopped outside...I looked up, and crossed my arms. Unfortunately, I'd been right.

They were hiding in the bank.

Immediately, I looked for an entrance that *wasn't* the front doors. I couldn't see anything when I scanned the plaza (other than a weird looking monument in the middle) other than an underground parking lot. I thought I'd try there first, so I headed down into it- the garage door, fortunately, was open and so I was able to walk straight in. There were no cars around here (the bank *was* abandoned, after all) and the security station on the other end of the parking garage had clearly been blown up recently. It was probably being used as a makeshift hideout, and probably didn't control anything anymore. Looking around the dim garage, I thought I spotted a vent cover. Of course - crawling through the vents would work, but she didn't know if she could squeeze in. I walked over to the cover and realized I still had the thermal vision on- Flicking the same switch on my arm, I felt my eye burn again, and instead could see with bright green night-vision. I blinked a tear back (it *hurt*) and found the vent. Luckily - I actually *could* squeeze in, so I shoved myself into the vent and began crawling through it. Granted, I'd no idea where it'd actually bring me, but I didn't want to walk straight into whatever crazy trap those nutjob Outsiders had no doubt cooked up.

I made quite a racket as I crawled through (weren't these supposed to be quiet?) but the vent system didn't collapse under me, and nobody shot at me. I guessed that I was deep in the system, probably on the lower levels of the bank now.
