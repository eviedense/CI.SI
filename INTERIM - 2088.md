The first thing I ever remember...was waking up. There was nothing before that. At least, that's what I was always told - but I'm not sure I believe them. Not that it matters, because if I push myself to try and remember whatever "before" was, nothing comes. I look down at my arms, and instead of seeing what I *should* see...I see metal arms attached to what was left of my own. I flex my fingers, but I don't feel anything...
