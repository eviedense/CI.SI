#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 25

*It's been four and a half months since Mikhail's arrest. I can still feel my knuckles sting. It doesn't feel like I won- even if I did. There's no murderer running loose. It's been quiet ever since. So why does it feel like I did something wrong?* She rubbed the palm of her hand against her knuckles. The skin still felt rough, coarse. She was lying in bed in her apartment, staring up at the ceiling. The lights were off. Around her, the shadows created by the outside street lights, cars, and neon signs stretched across the ceiling and the walls. *Oh wait,* She realized. *It's because I don't really have a purpose now, do I?*

When the police had finally gotten Mikhail, they stepped up their game. Crime had been on a steady slide down ever since December. Cisila would still go out at night, and occasionally she'd find something...but most of the time, it had already been taken care of. It had felt more like a waste of time. *And they see me as a criminal too.* The mask and her poor outfit choices didn't help. But there was something bugging her. Why, only now, had the police decided to actually do their job?

Were they forced to? Was a murderer just too much to ignore? What about the ongoing gang problem? She'd had to deal with that. It was worse, far worse than a spree of murders across a short span of time. It was like a parasite, eating the city from the inside out. But they'd just been *ignoring* it. Then, her eyebrows furrowed. *They've been ignoring everything to do with the gangs. I've been the only one to stop drug trades. Weapon trades-* (the images of the weapons flashed through her head) *- and worst of all, fucking organs.*

She felt bad just thinking about it. How was anyone able to get near human organs and not feel sick? Shaking her head to herself, she shifted away from those thoughts. *So if they've been ignoring the gangs...*  Her mind sorted through all the information she had, *...then, really, there's only a couple outcomes. They're being paid off, or they're in on it. Hell, maybe there's even someone at the top who's directing attention away.* There were too many things that she didn't know to come to any of these conclusions. Sighing to herself (rather loudly), she looked out the half-open window. It was raining rather hard. The rain was pouring down like an avalanche, with a constant, dreary white noise able to be heard. The neon signs glowed through the rain, which diffused the light and made it look even brighter. Even harder to look at. She made a face at the closest neon sign (a jeweler's shop) and rolled onto her side, facing away from the window. She heard her phone buzz on the bedside table and watched it flare to life, blinding her for a moment. Cisila grumbled, and yanked it off the table, holding it to her face. Lyla had sent a message.

She tapped the notification, reading through Lyla's message. Ever since she had broken free from Mikhail, she had started to help Cisila. She was a little enthusiastic, leaving immediately after work to do - whatever - but it *was* nice to have help. And tonight, it looked like she'd found something. *There's a truck heading south,* The message started. That wasn't unusual. Cisila continued to read, *Got a look inside before they closed it up. There's a big fuckall box in there, about the size of a human. Could be bad.* Cisila frowned. Lyla had forgotten to say *who* it was. If it was one of the three gangs, that wasn't cause for alarm. If it was the police, ignore it. But if it was PALMER-EDEN...that one was an emergency. She quickly replied to Lyla's message, asking, *Who was it?*.

Waiting for a response, she stared at the small bubbles indicating that Lyla was typing. Then the message finally popped up. *It's Palmer.* Her eyes went wide. *Oh, fuck,* she thought. *Okay, think.* She jolted up in her bed. It creaked slightly as she did. There were two questions that stood out. *What's in the box? And why are they moving it? There's only one thing that Palmer would have to move that was human sized...someone like me. A superhuman, probably.* She paused. *It could just be some random stuff, though.* Cisila pursed her lips, thinking hard. *On the other hand, why would some random stuff need to be moved AWAY from the company tower?*

She typed out a question to Lyla. *Was it the only thing in the truck?* Tapping send, she continued to debate on whatever else it could be. However, her mind had gotten stuck on the prospect of Palmer continuing the old Project Eden. The one that resulted in her, and a handful of other people, having the abilities that didn't belong to them. Lyla quickly shot a message back, saying, *It was. It wasn't a big truck. More like a van, if I'm being honest.* Okay, that was even worse. *Can you follow it?* She sent. *I need your location, too. I have to see this.* Cisila hopped out of bed without even waiting for a response, yanked open the loose floorboard next to her bed and pulled the mask out of its hiding hole. Another notification popped up. Lyla's location. And then, *Hurry up then.* from Lyla. She shoved her phone into her pocket, pulled her mask on and pulled a jacket off of the floor. Pulling it on, she looked around to make sure she didn't need anything else.

The answer was no. Pieces of metal wound by wire creating a strange exoskeleton slowly wrapped around Cisila's arms, legs, and her shoulders. Wires connected, and the EXO fastened her jacket tight to her arms so it wouldn't make too much noise. On her left arm, a small grapple device clicked together and she could hear the small coil inside whirring the cable around itself. She pulled the hood of her jacket over her hair, double-checked that the mask was fastened, and then vaulted through the window and into the night.

She pulled the window down behind her and locked it, before climbing up the fire escape and onto the rooftops. The rain poured down harder as she leapt across the buildings, following her phone's directions towards Lyla. Bright neon signs flashed by her as she sped past, sliding and vaulting over the messy rooftops. Sprinting at full speed, she leapt off a building, straight over a large intersection. Flinging her left arm out, a strong cable shot out of the grapple device strapped to her arm. It latched onto one of the buildings across the street and she felt herself lurch forward as the cable pulled her towards the building at an alarming rate. She reached out and latched onto the side of the building before the grapple slammed her straight into the side. She flicked her wrist and the cable flew back into the grapple. Shaking her head, she yanked herself onto the roof.

Several minutes later, Cisila finally skidded to a stop on top of a large warehouse with a slanted roof. On the far side, Lyla was crouched overlooking the warehouse. She turned to look back at Cisila when she heard her. "It's in here." She said. Lyla was wearing a rain jacket and had her hood pulled up. She carefully walked along the roof to a skylight, and kneeled next to it. Cisila followed, and knelt right next to her. "Have they done anything weird?" Cisila said, tilting her head towards Lyla. She shook her head, "No. It looks like they're waiting on something."
