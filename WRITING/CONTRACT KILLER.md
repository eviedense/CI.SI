#### LYLA ANTTONEN, 20

A large nightclub in Vantaa was alive with bright lights. They came from every orifice of the building, oozing and spilling out onto the outside. It was like a beacon in the middle of nowhere. People inside danced, drank, and all of them were having a good time. But outside of the club, perched on an old, rusting billboard that had a decades old ad plastered on it, a lone person watched the club through a pair of binoculars. They were wearing a dark grey coat with a popped collar, half buttoned up. Underneath it, they had on a tight turtleneck that looked constricting - and finally, they were wearing dark black jeans, and combat boots. Carefully looking at every single person they could see on the roof, in the courtyard...everywhere. When someone passed by the windows, they watched. Waiting. *Paskiainen...where is he?* She lowered her binoculars, *Fucking asshat. I bet he's caught on by this point.* If her target, the one she'd been *paid* to kill, had somehow caught on, that meant he'd either stay inside, or leave. And she would've caught him leaving by now. The bright orange and green lights emanating out of the club silhouetted most of the people, but the target's body type would make him easy to spot. She knew this. Lyla had been watching him for most of the last day. In fact, she'd picked up that he'd be here tonight from one of his own bodyguards. Hearing the music in the distance, Lyla couldn't help but frown. She *hated* loud music like this. It was going to be almost cathartic, killing someone in a place like this. Somewhere she despised. Remembering that she did in fact have to kill him, she opened up the large, sturdy briefcase sitting beside her on the billboard. A sniper rifle, taken apart to fit in the case, was inside. She started to pull the parts out and slowly slide them together. She slid the barrel onto the receiver, twisting it so it fit properly. She slid the large scope over the Picatinny rail that ran along the top of the rifle. Finally, she attached the folding stock and a large, bulky suppressor. There wasn't enough space for her to lie down, so Lyla wouldn't be able to use a bipod. Instead of trying to hold it awkwardly, she propped the barrel up with her left forearm, taking hold of the pistol grip with her right hand. Peering down the scope with one of fiery orange-red eyes, she watched. 

She carefully watched the courtyard in the middle of the nightclub. Dozens of people were outside, chatting. Drinking. The crosshair of her rifle slid over them slowly, pointing at their heads before moving on to the next person. *Not him. Not him, either.* She pointed her rifle towards one of the many windows showing the inside of the nightclub. Lyla looked through them carefully. She was already impatient, so where the hell was he? And then she aimed her rifle down at the front doors. And there he was. The man seemed to be waving goodbye to someone. And that someone was a woman. *...The contract came from his wife.* Lyla remembered. *Think she must've been pissed enough at him to get someone to kill him. I wonder what he did...* But that didn't matter. Not to her father, anyways. She was only here to kill him. Slowly, Lyla steadied her aim. The crosshair was dead-on with the back of the man's head. *You're dead, you piece of shit.* And swiftly, she pulled the trigger. A quiet *thnk* and a powerful recoil pushed the rifle back, slamming the butt of the stock into Lyla's shoulder. Everything seemed to slow down as the bullet pierced through the air, flying straight towards the back of the man's head. The rifling from the barrel had put a spin on the bullet. Everything had lined up for a *perfect* kill. Lyla watched through the scope as the bullet made contact, and blew a hole in her target's head. It pierced through his skin, his *skull,* tore through his brain, and came out the other side. And she smiled as he hit the ground. The distant screams of panic told her all she needed to know. Lyla lowered the rifle slowly, and started to take it apart, and put it back in its briefcase. She clicked it shut. Pulling out her phone, she hesitated for a moment. *I did it.* She was supposed to call her father when it was done. *I've done it. So why am I getting a bad feeling?* Shaking her head, she relented. Calling her father, Lyla held the phone up to the side of her head. "Yes?" Her father's monotone voice answered. "He's down." Lyla said. "Tell the wife." Her father inhaled, "Right. Move to your safehouse in the area, I've got something else for you. And don't even *think* about taking a break." She frowned. *Fuck you.* Was her only response to that, but if she said it, her father would probably kill her. 

"...Yes." Lyla said, simply. "Yes *sir.*" Her father corrected. Grumbling, Lyla fixed her response. "Yes, sir." And she hung up. *Paskiainen.* She thought, as she picked up the briefcase and climbed her way back down the billboard. The ground was solid. There weren't many trees in the area- to her disadvantage. If someone saw her near here, they might connect her to the hit. So she quickly left, heading towards one of the small safehouses her father had as part of his hitman business. *Business. Pssht.* As if it could even be called that. Lyla had been doing this for four years now, and she failed to see the reason why. Most people, like the contract she'd just finished, wanted someone killed for wronging them. *A cheater. A robber. Someone who committed corporate espionage.* Other times, it would be businesses- large companies that wanted something hidden. And usually, this was done by killing the one who'd been trying to leak whatever secrets they wanted to stay buried. As Lyla drew closer to the safehouse, in a large apartment complex, she began to see people: most were out for a walk at night, others looked lost. *Not like I care, though.* Lyla watched them as she passed by, as if they were curiosities, and not people. She'd had friends in school, of course, but that must have been years ago by now. The only people she talked to were her relatives. Her parents. Her grandparents. Aunts and uncles. All of them benefitted from Lyla doing hits. But she hated *all* of them. They were insufferable at best, and rage filled at worst. Every time she could, she'd avoid them. It was the one time that taking contracts would help her. A large family dinner? *No thanks, I've got a hit to do. You benefit from it, so don't complain.* But other than that, it was a repeating cycle. Hit, sleep, wake up, hit. There was never time for anything else. Casually walking into the apartment complex, she headed up to the safehouse on the fifth floor. The building was drab on the inside: the usual carpeted floor stained slightly from use, and wooden doors and doorframes for every apartment. Lyla walked down the dim hallway of the fifth floor, heading towards the end. Pulling out a keyring with a dozen or so keys on it, she fumbled, trying to find the correct key. After a few seconds of trying keys, she found the correct one. The lock *clicked* open, and she stepped into the safehouse. It was mostly empty. The only light in the room was off. Realizing how tired she was, Lyla sat down on the small couch propped against the wall. She set the suitcase down on the floor, and leaned back. Lyla exhaled. And inhaled. And exhaled. 

Not feeling like getting up, she sat in the dark. Shadows loomed over the whole apartment, the only light coming from the open windows. It only took a few minutes for her phone to ring. Groaning, she pulled it out and answered. "Got something that requires a little more work. Target's up in Helsinki." Her father said, plainly. *Helsinki? Must be important.* She thought, before responding, "What's it for? Any details?" Sitting up, she waited for her father's response. "Seems like a big one. Our, uh, *client,* has asked us to kill him. He owns a large pharmaceutical company, so I did a bit of digging. S'called PALMER-EDEN." *Palmer whatnow?* Lyla figured this must've been some bullshit start-up. "Sounds like BS." Lyla responded. "...It's not." Her father grunted. "Big in America, so I hear. Our client's paid us a metric fuckton to get rid of him. Sounds like competition to me." *Competition...* Lyla smiled. "Alright. Sounds like fun." Her father didn't respond for a good few seconds, before saying, "No. It's work." Lyla's smile immediately turned right back into a frown. "...Right. Just give me the location." And she hung up.
