Rain poured down hard on a small military controlled island in the middle of the gigantic pacific oceans. A terrible storm, the worst they'd had in months. The only sounds the soldiers on post could hear were the droplets hitting the ground. The island itself a reasonable size, and held some kind of research facility out in the middle of nowhere. And now, in the middle of this storm, was Cisila's only possible chance of survival. Clinging to the side of a cliff on the far side of the island, she pulled down her night-vision goggles. With a small, high-pitched whirr, they came to life. She blinked, took a second, and looked out at the ocean behind her. The ocean itself was crashing waves relentlessly against the island, twenty metres or so below herself. Cisila heaved a sigh and made sure her feet were planted against the cliffside, and she tugged against the cable that connected her to her destination- the top of the cliff. And in her head, as she began to tug herself up the cliff, she went over why she was even here. The first words that came to mind were *"You're expendable."*. Her handler had said that to her, and while it was definitely true, it *hurt.* But the whole conversation hadn't just been that. "Command wants you for something." Her handler had said. "It's your first mission." She'd nodded, but felt concerned. And then when he'd explained what she was doing, Cisila felt dread. "Your first mission is going to be solo. There's a splinter faction of an American terrorist cell that got away. We've taken down the main cell, but this splinter faction could be a problem. However," He'd pulled out a manilla folder and put it down on his desk, "We need sufficient evidence to engage them. What *you're* doing, is getting that evidence." Cisila felt her lip twitch, but continued to listen. "So. You're going in alone." He'd said. "Not because you're particularly good at anything, but because you're expendable." Cisila looked down at the folder and nodded. "Get in, get our evidence...and get out. If you're lucky, you'll live. Nobody's expecting you to really do this." He'd finished, and leaned back in his back. Cisila nodded once again, "...Yes, sir." she'd mumbled.

And now, against a cliff in the middle of the night, Cisila was in a life or death situation. She might have been equipped to the teeth with military gear, but most of it couldn't be used. The clunky M1014 tied to her backpack was basically useless, since command had said this was a stealth mission. If she had to kill, she'd have to do it silently. She continued to pull herself up the cliff, feeling the wet rocks crumble gently under her gloved hands. She heaved herself up to the next support, and then the next. Cisila could slip at any point, and she was carefully monitoring each of her footholds to make sure she was one hundred percent supported. Slowly, she continued to climb up, when suddenly...she heard the rotors of a helicopter. Cisila pressed herself against the rock, praying she wouldn't be seen. The loud rotors powering the helicopter got extremely deafening as the helicopter drew closer, and she sucked in a breath, and held it, pressing herself into the rock as much she could. Cisila couldn't see it, but the helicopter flew right overhead and out onto the Pacific. Heaving a sigh of relief, she continued to pull herself up the cliff. Slowly but surely, she made her way up. The rain continued to pour down harder as the radio strapped to her vest came to life, feeding its audio to her headphones. *"Are you there yet?"* Her new superior said, her voice crackling through the radio. Cisila let go of one of her footholds with her left hand and flicked a switch on the radio, "Almost." She mumbled. "Nearly up the cliff. Just give me a second, captain." And she let go of the radio, continuing to climb up, slowly. After another minute of climbing, she pulled herself up onto the edge of the cliff. Kneeling down and observing her surroundings, she flicked the radio's switch again. "I'm up." She said, as rain poured down on her in full force. *"Great."* Her captain, Kellien, said. *"Glad you're not a slowpoke like the last one. You remember what you're in for, Six?"* Six. Her new designation, as part of "DELTA" squad. 

"...Yes, ma'am." Cisila said. Kellien replied, *"Alright, well...just to keep it clear in your head- two things. First, you don't have backup, so if you get into a firefight, you're dead. Second, a chopper's going to pick you up on the south side of the island- it's the safest spot for a chopper to land. If we're lucky, nobody will notice in this storm."* Cisila sighed, "Right. Yes. Where's the information I'm looking for?" She asked. *"The main building. Someone on the inside has a few doors unlocked, and pulled the covers off a few vents, which should give you an easier time."* Kellien explained. *"Good luck."* She added, and Cisila flicked her radio off. Looking up, the large facility's lights made her night vision goggles practically useless- all that she could see was bright, white light. Gripping the side of the goggles, she lifted them up, and they turned off. *Ugh.* She wiped her face, having already gotten drenched in rain. Instead of using her night vision goggles, she pulled out a pair of binocs from her backpack and held them up to her eyes. The facility wasn't exactly up to specifications, but security seemed to be tight. This splinter faction seemed to know what they were doing. And according to command, there were between a hundred and two hundred soldiers stationed on this island. *That's a big difference...and if there's two hundred, then I don't think I can get through this.*  She thought, surveying the facility's roads and checkpoints up to the main building. Large trucks were parked outside the main entrance, probably as extra security. Even on an island, they took this many precautions. They were *not* playing around. She turned her binocs towards the other main entrance, and saw the same thing. *So there's no way I'm getting through either of those entrances.* Which was obvious, she knew. So, putting her binocs away, she snuck down the hill and hid behind some bushes, watching the road that connected the main facility to smaller ones on the east and west sides of the island. 

And then Cisila began to realize that some of the information command had gotten seemed to be wrong. The north side of the island seemed to be entirely taken up by the facility. It was *massive.* It stretched to the end of the island, and that meant there was no possible spot for a helicopter to pick her up. And if that was the case, then she had no way out. She flicked on her radio quickly, and said, "Captain. It seems like...I don't have a way out." Cisila waited for a response. All she got was static. "Captain?" She repeated. Still nothing. Dejectedly, she turned the radio off. There was only one thing she could do now, and that was execute the mission she was even here to do. *Not like I've got anything better to do.*

So she stood up, and made her way to the facility, ducking in and out of hiding spots carefully.
