### SGT. Cisila J. Siveta, 25

The blazing heat of the sun beat down on the sand. The rocks. Heat waves surrounded Cisila as she sat, hidden in a cluster of large boulders. In her hands was a large anti-materiel rifle chamber in .50 BMG. It could take down a tank, but in her hands, in this moment, it would blow the enemy's heads apart. Cisila was fitted in desert combat gear, camouflaged in the sandy rocks. Against her better judgment, Cisila had ended up here. It had been months since Adam's destruction, and the U.S government had found her. They'd forced her to keep quiet. They had forced her into a squad of other Ultima, who were constantly sent on suicide missions. This was one of them, but the squad, from Cisila's knowledge, has persevered through every single mission. They had survived, much to the chagrin of the U.S government. Not only did they survive, they were deadly efficient. Their captain, a woman named Kellien, had welcomed Cisila with open arms. The rest quickly accepted her. There was no need for arguments. They were all in this situation for the same reason: the U.S government had found them, and realized they were a danger. Their knowledge would collapse companies, and it seemed like Cisila was one of those, with her knowledge of PALMER-EDEN. As she sat waiting in the rocks, she wondered what everybody else had done to be discovered. To be captured. But her train of thought was quickly broken as the only sound in her vicinity blared in her ear. The crackling radio system. "T-minus three minutes, Six." Kellien's voice said. Cisila was designated Six. Slowly, she heaved the heavy and bulky sniper rifle up, positioning herself as comfortable as possible, and resting the tripod of the rifle on a rock. "Remember," Kellien said, "Don't hit our objective. He needs to be alive- I think." Cisila leaned forward, carefully holding onto the sniper and  staring down the scope. She held her left hand up into the air and felt the wind- there was none. No wind movement to account for. The only thing she needed to think about was height. Reaching towards the instruments on the scope, she started to adjust them, making her shot easier. Their target was a large, armored vehicle heading through Libya. It was an American vehicle, carrying a prisoner. Once Cisila hit the driver, and the vehicle came to a stop, the rest of the squad, called Delta squad, would pop out and shoot down anyone remaining. Cisila followed the dirt road from the horizon, down to where her vision was cut off by rocks. As she moved the sniper rifle down, the scope glinted in the light. She could see her fellow squadmates hiding behind rock formations as she scanned the road, waiting for the vehicle to appear. "Reminder that once we get him, we need to call in our extraction." Kellien said. "Does everybody understand? This isn't over until we get on the chopper." What followed was a series of confirmations from the other four squad members, and Cisila added, "Yes ma'am." as she returned to her original position, watching the road. Pulling back from the scope, Cisila pulled the bolt of the rifle back to check that the .50 BMG round was chambered properly. As the bolt slid back smoothly, she stopped it halfway- so as to not cause a jam. She could see the gold-coloured case of the bullet sitting neatly inside the chamber. Cisila snapped the bolt shut and flicked it downwards. "Everything's good up here, in case anyone's wondering." She said into her radio, which was strapped to her combat vest. "How's everyone else doing?" She asked.

"Burning up down here," Delta-Two said. His actual name was Dakota, and everybody referred to him as "Dak". After Kellien, he was the second member ever introduced to Delta Squad. "Once this is over, I'm taking a *cold* fucking shower." Dak muttered. "Feels like I've sweat through my gear already," Delta-Four said. Her name was Gaia, and she tended to be quite jittery- if anyone would mess up a mission, it would've been her. But even then, she never did. "I get that you're all dying of heat stroke out here," Kellien said, "But we need to focus." She was right. As Cisila looked down the scope again and let her finger lie on the trigger guard, she spotted the armored truck. "Tango spotted." Cisila rattled off, aiming the scope towards it, accounting for height. "Get ready to roll."
