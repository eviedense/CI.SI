### SGT. Cisila J. Siveta, 25

The blazing heat of the sun beat down on the sand. The rocks. Heat waves surrounded Cisila as she sat, hidden in a cluster of large boulders. In her hands was a large anti-materiel rifle chamber in .50 BMG. It could take down a tank, but in her hands, in this moment, it would blow the enemy's heads apart. Cisila was fitted in desert combat gear, camouflaged in the sandy rocks. Against her better judgment, Cisila had ended up here. It had been months since Adam's destruction, and the U.S government had found her. They'd forced her to keep quiet. They had forced her into a squad of other Ultima, who were constantly sent on suicide missions. This was one of them, but the squad, from Cisila's knowledge, has persevered through every single mission. They had survived, much to the chagrin of the U.S government. Not only did they survive, they were deadly efficient. Their captain, a woman named Kellien, had welcomed Cisila with open arms. The rest quickly accepted her. There was no need for arguments. They were all in this situation for the same reason: the U.S government had found them, and realized they were a danger. Their knowledge would collapse companies, and it seemed like Cisila was one of those, with her knowledge of PALMER-EDEN. As she sat waiting in the rocks, she wondered what everybody else had done to be discovered. To be captured. But her train of thought was quickly broken as the only sound in her vicinity blared in her ear. The crackling radio system. "T-minus three minutes, Six." Kellien's voice said. Cisila was designated Six. Slowly, she heaved the heavy and bulky sniper rifle up, positioning herself as comfortable as possible, and resting the tripod of the rifle on a rock. "Remember," Kellien said, "Don't hit our objective. He needs to be alive- I think." Cisila leaned forward, carefully holding onto the sniper and  staring down the scope. She held her left hand up into the air and felt the wind- there was none. No wind movement to account for. The only thing she needed to think about was height. Reaching towards the instruments on the scope, she started to adjust them, making her shot easier. Their target was a large, armored vehicle heading through Libya. It was an American vehicle, carrying a prisoner. Once Cisila hit the driver, and the vehicle came to a stop, the rest of the squad, called Delta squad, would pop out and shoot down anyone remaining. Cisila followed the dirt road from the horizon, down to where her vision was cut off by rocks. As she moved the sniper rifle down, the scope glinted in the light. She could see her fellow squadmates hiding behind rock formations as she scanned the road, waiting for the vehicle to appear. "Reminder that once we get him, we need to call in our extraction." Kellien said. "Does everybody understand? This isn't over until we get on the chopper." What followed was a series of confirmations from the other four squad members, and Cisila added, "Yes ma'am." as she returned to her original position, watching the road. Pulling back from the scope, Cisila pulled the bolt of the rifle back to check that the .50 BMG round was chambered properly. As the bolt slid back smoothly, she stopped it halfway- so as to not cause a jam. She could see the gold-coloured case of the bullet sitting neatly inside the chamber. Cisila snapped the bolt shut and flicked it downwards. "Everything's good up here, in case anyone's wondering." She said into her radio, which was strapped to her combat vest. "How's everyone else doing?" She asked.

"Burning up down here," Delta-Two said. His actual name was Dakota, and everybody referred to him as "Dak". After Kellien, he was the second member ever introduced to Delta Squad. "Once this is over, I'm taking a *cold* fucking shower." Dak muttered. "Feels like I've sweat through my gear already," Delta-Four said. Her name was Gaia, and she tended to be quite jittery- if anyone would mess up a mission, it would've been her. But even then, she never did. "I get that you're all dying of heat stroke out here," Kellien said, "But we need to focus." She was right. As Cisila looked down the scope again and let her finger lie on the trigger guard, she spotted the armored truck. "Tango spotted." Cisila rattled off, aiming the scope towards it, accounting for height. "Get ready to roll." Almost immediately, the radio went silent. Everybody waited for the vehicle to cross the invisible line where Cisila was supposed to shoot it. As it rolled along the dirt road, in the desert, it bounced and bumped softly along the uneven terrain. "Ready..." Kellien hissed. "Aim-" Cisila folded her finger down onto the hair trigger of the rifle. The large tires of the armored truck sent plumes of dust kicking up in its wake, as it rolled past. "FIRE!" Kellien yelled into her radio, and immediately, Cisila pulled the trigger. She had made sure the scope was lined up properly. The height was accounted for, aswell as the distance that the truck would travel in the time it would take for the bullet to reach it. In her head, she had done intensive math. The first thing that she felt was the entire rifle jolt backwards as the firing pin rammed into the bullet, igniting the gunpowder and sending the bullet flying out of the barrel, that of which was rifled and sent the bullet into an intense spin as it left the barrel. As the stock of the rifle shoved itself back into Cisila's shoulder, the rifle boomed, and the muzzle flashed. For all intents and purposes, it was *loud.* But the driver didn't have any time to react, as almost as soon as they'd heard the booming rifle, the bullet had crashed through the window, piercing it, and the bullet lodged itself in the driver's head, breaking through their helmet. They were dead, immediately. "Bingo." Cisila said, racking the bolt. With a slick *ching,* the smoking bullet casing flew out of the ejection port and fell to the rock floor with a rattle. The truck went out of control as soon as the driver's hands slid off the wheel, and within a few seconds, it had slid to a stop, wheeling around. As the truck came to a stop, the bullet lodged in the driver's head suddenly exploded- drenching the entire cabin in blood. "That's your signal," Cisila said, "Go get him."

She listened to the chatter of her squadmates as they climbed out of their hiding spots and converged on the truck. As they approached, Cisila spotted them through her scope. "Nothing's happening," Kellien hissed, approaching the truck slowly, her assault rifle raised. She forced open the passenger side door, and looked inside. "Looks like that exploding round killed the passenger- urgh- Kellien hissed, jumping back. The blood-covered corpse of the passenger fell out of the seat and hit the ground, spattering the dirt with blood. "Not a big deal." Kellien said, before climbing onto the stairs to get into the truck. While inside, she looked around. The rest of Delta Squad surrounded the vehicle, rifles trained on it. Kellien seemed to rummage through the truck, before swearing right into her radio. Hopping out of the truck, she held up another set of comms she'd pulled off the driver. "Just heard it off this," Kellien explained, "They know we're here." There was a crushing silence for a moment. *Shit,* Cisila thought. "You need to get out of there, then." She said. "You're sitting ducks like that, out in the open." The rest of the squad mumbled agreements, "They're probably sending someone to get us right now..." Delta-Four said. "Move, then!" Delta-Two said, "We need some cover. At least-" But whatever Two was going to say, he was cut off as they heard the roar of not one, but three more armored vehicles in the distance. Cisila felt her insides seize up as, in addition, she heard the whirring blades of a large chopper. "They were *waiting* for us..." Kellien hissed. "What kind of fucking setup..." She muttered, looking at the trucks in the distance. "Six, you've got clearance to take them out. Use the high-powered rounds, those low yield boys aren't going to penetrate the truck armor with their explosives." Cisila pulled the bolt back once more, letting the full cartridge of the low yield explosive bullet fling out, and she pulled the magazine out with a click. "You got it." She said, pulling another full magazine out of her vest. "If you can, aim for the drivers. It'd help." The squad acknowledged her request, and down below, they set up a small defense using the empty truck as a barrier. Cisila turned her attention towards the approaching trucks, and she snapped the bolt shut and pulled it down, chambering a round of the high-powered explosive bullets. First, she'd hit the trucks. And then, if she could, she'd aim for the approaching chopper. Cisila centered her scope on the trucks, adjusting for height. "Ready." She hissed.
