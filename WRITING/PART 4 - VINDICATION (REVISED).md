#### endless fight - Yakuza 5 - SEGA SOUND TEAM

Her entire body had gone numb. She had lost all feeling. Around her, the bright lights flashed and the crowd around her cheered and leered, as she fell back against the high-tension ropes around the ring. Her back pressing into it, Stephanie weakly raised her hand to her lip and wiped blood from it. She was struggling to stand. Her opponent at the other end of the ring cracked their neck from side to side, still full of energy. Stephanie herself was covered in bruises and cuts, and her gloves were starting to fall apart. Her tanktop was drenched in sweat, that of which also rolled down her forehead as she pulled herself back up slowly, limping. The fighting ring was flooded in blue, purple and pink lights. Surrounding it, there were sets of bleachers raised above it so the onlookers could see every detail of the fight. As she stood back up properly, shaking her head, Stephanie's hair caught the light. Her bright hot pink hair, the black roots of her hair, and her thin face. She had ear piercings and eyeshadow on, but because of the intense situation it was in, the eyeshadow was starting to mix with her sweat and disappear slowly. Stephanie blinked slowly, scrunching her eyes shut before opening them wide. Her opponent was waiting for her to get back into the zone, and she obliged, slowly raising her fists again. Her bare arms were bandaged up from previous injuries, and it looked like she had been fighting all night. Stephanie, by this point, was on her last legs. But this next opponent couldn't stop her, surely. As they stepped towards her, Stephanie went in for a jab at their stomach, but they grabbed onto her arm and bashed her away. Stumbling backwards, Stephanie shook her head and, instead of going in for another punch, whipped around and raised her leg up, kicking her opponent in the face. A powerful *crunch* came from the opponent's face as her foot made contact, and their head whipped to the right. Using her brief opportunity, she went in for a three-step combo. A jab to the stomach, and then an uppercut into the jaw, followed up by a kick to the stomach, sending her opponent skidding away. Grunting, they let out a yell and rushed at Stephanie. *FUCK!* Her mind screamed, and she barely ducked out of the way, instead letting her opponent smash right into the high-tension ropes, which bounced them back. Thinking she had a moment to attack, Stephanie went in for a heavy punch to her opponent's face, but she got caught first as the opponent knocked her arm out of the way and bashed her in the face. Spitting blood out of her mouth, Stephanie returned the punch as hard as she could. It didn't do much, and the two started trading blows. Each hit made Stephanie feel even more numb than before. And it kept getting worse. She stopped feeling everything. Her opponent's fist went straight into her cheek and she felt her arms drop to her sides. 

The crowd's cheering got even louder, before it started to fade away. Everything went fuzzy around her. Stephanie didn't even feel it when she hit the floor, because she had already gone unconscious.

It felt like only a brief moment before she felt someone prodding her cheek. Stephanie felt herself wake back up, and she slowly opened her eyes. *"Ugh...*" She mumbled, raising her head a little to look up at who was above her. Making a 'tch' sound, she let her drop back down, dejected. It was just Maria, her sister. She had been there to watch Stephanie fight again. "Hey..." Stephanie heard Maria say, through her buzzing ears. "Hey. Steph." Maria repeated. She grunted a response and refused to move, shutting her eyes again. It was only now she felt her entire body in pain. Stephanie let out a deep sigh and finally spoke properly. "Maria..." She mumbled, "Can you...not?" \
Stephanie slowly opened her eyes once more and looked up at Maria, and finally noticed that she wasn't lying in the ring. "Not what?" Maria said, pulling Stephanie up from the bench she was lying on, and sitting next to her. They were in one of the back rooms of the fighting club, and the lights were a bright, painful white, which reflected off of the metal sinks bolted to the walls. Stephanie had no idea who actually *used* those sinks, but there were a lot of them in the back rooms. She frowned and looked at Maria, "I mean..." Stephanie muttered, "quit *following* me here. I don't know what you're trying to do." She wiped her lip again, before Maria handed her a towel. Taking it, she dried her face. "You always end up like that." Maria stated, "Mom always gets worried. Tries to call you, only for you to end up in the hospital in the morning without a word." She pushed her black hair out of her eyes and sighed, adjusting her sunglasses- which, for some reason, she was wearing indoors. But Stephanie tended to do that aswell, so she couldn't judge. Maria was wearing her black jacket aswell as her favourite pair of worn blue jeans. Stephanie was dressed in her fighting ring getup: Her grey tanktop, and a pair of black cargo pants, and a worn pair of runners. "I don't care what Mom thinks." Steph said, lowering the towel. "She doesn't even like me." She sighed, "so why does she care so fucking much about my safety?" \
Maria stared at her for a moment, blinking behind her sunglasses. "Uh- er..." She mumbled, "I dunno." Stephanie rolled her eyes and slowly got up. She slowly limped over to the lockers on the other side of the room, and pulled her own one opening after fumbling with the lock. Slowly, she changed into her usual outfit. A jacket made with a mix of cotton, fabric and leather. The leather was almost like an accent, while the cotton and fabric made up the main part of the jacket. It was quite soft, but firm. Like her hair, the jacket's colours were hot pink and black. It was an equal amount of pink and black, so as to not overdo the colours. She'd had it made for her personally, and as she pulled it on, she slowly buttoned it up. The collar was rather large, and she flipped it up. She changed her cargo pants into a pair of pristine black jeans, and swapped out her runners with hiking boots, coloured grey. "Just go back home, Maria..." Stephanie said, rubbing her eyes. "I'll be back soon." \
Maria took a moment to respond, as she was looking down at her hands. "Huh?" She sputtered, looking up. "S-sorry, yeah...yeah, I'll go. Yeah." Maria mumbled, getting up slowly and heading towards the exit of the back room. Before she pulled open the door, Maria looked back at Stephanie, who was just sliding her aviators over her eyes. "Steph..." Maria said, adjusting her own glasses. Stephanie didn't respond, and instead pulled her satchel over her shoulder. "Steph." Maria repeated. "...Huh?" Stephanie muttered, looking up at Maria. "Steph- you..." Maria bit her lip uncomfortably, and she fumbled with the door handle, trying to find the right words to say. "Mom doesn't..." she paused again, letting out a deep breath. Maria looked nervous. "Mom doesn't...want you home today." She finally said, after a couple seconds of awkward silence. \
"W- what?" Stephanie asked, raising an eyebrow. "Why not?" Maria silently stared at her for a moment, before shaking her head. "She didn't tell me why. She just...she just told me..." she mumbled, trailing off. Stephanie felt her emotions fade away for a moment, as she was left confused. "What- I..." She stuttered, "I don't-...why?" Stephanie asked again, her eyes wide behind her aviators. Maria ignored her, and instead pulled the door open, and stepped out. She left Stephanie standing in the empty backroom, staring at the door. 

There wasn't much Stephanie felt anymore, but it was like a switch had flipped in her head. She knew exactly why her mother didn't want her home. And that meant she'd finally made up her mind. Sighing deeply, Stephanie turned away from the main exit and headed towards the other door on the opposite end of the room. Opening it with a key and stepping through into the main club, she fought to keep her tears back. *Deep breaths.* She thought. *Deep. Breaths.* \
Her mother no longer considered her her family. And that also meant she was no longer a girl to her mother, either. Stephanie knew that her mother wouldn't want to be near her after she'd finally come out, but she just couldn't understand why her mother still thought she was a boy. It had been years of work, and she felt confident in herself. She pushed her thoughts away as she made her way along the empty club floor. The entire club was a conglomerate of all sorts, she remembered, trying to take her mind off of things. The fighting ring she'd fight in was only a side part to the main nightclub, which had a bar attached. It was called *La Lune Brillante*, or *The Bright Moon* in English. It was where she spent most of her time. Walking across the empty club floor, she looked upwards at the DJ booth and the second floor. Stephanie had never been up there...maybe, next time she came, she'd check it out. Not like she'd have much better to do...shaking her head, she walked over to the entrance and pushed the two old doors open, stepping out into the abandoned subway tunnel that the club had been built in. There was graffiti and makeshift lights set up to make the tunnel more welcoming, but it still gave Stephanie the creeps. The subway tunnel had been closed for decades, ever since 2003. She knew it was related to a horrible accident one of the subway trains had found itself in, and one of the exits was blocked completely, a building collapsed over it. The local city council had elected to completely rebuild the subway system's underground tunnels, while favouring the L Train system to keep traffic under control. Heading down the tunnel, Stephanie found a ladder to climb up that she knew ended up in an empty street that nobody went to. She gripped onto the ladder, and began to pull herself upwards. Each step she took up the ladder made an echoing *clang,* bouncing off the tunnel walls. After a brief climb, Stephanie pushed the manhole cover out of the way and pulled herself up onto an empty street, where the only lights were street lights, that of which flickered on and off. Their bulbs had been replaced by the club staff, so instead of a warm orange, the street lights shone purple down on the street. Pulling her phone out of her jacket's pocket, Stephanie looked at her messages, of which she had a few. Her friends were wondering where she was again...and why she hadn't shown up to their party. Uninterested in responding, and too overwhelmed to do more. Stephanie put her phone away and headed down an alleyway between two buildings. She could probably sneak back into her room in her mother's house and lock the door, but that would likely only work for one night. And there was *still* the walk home. As she walked through the alleyway, the darkness seemed to swallow her briefly, no lights near enough to send any light into the alleyway. She continued to walk, and walk along the alleyway. When, suddenly...

Something meaty crunched underneath her foot. A bone snapped. "What th-" Stephanie sputtered, stumbling back. She quickly pulled out her phone and turned on its flashlight, and nearly screamed. A man was slumped against the wall, filled with bullet and knife wounds. *A murder...* \
It took her a moment to notice, but when did, she almost threw up. There was a large hole torn out from his chest, where his heart was. *Was.* She thought. *It...doesn't look like it's there anymore.* She kneeled down next to the man slowly and tried to see if he had any belongings still on him. Stephanie wasn't one to help too often, but it felt warranted that she at least tried to find out who the man was. Nobody else had found him, including the police, which meant that she would be a sole witness. But what she didn't consider as she stood up, was that she could be a suspect aswell. Something she missed was that being found next to a body was very damning.

And as she turned away from the body, she noticed a figure step into the alleyway. Stephanie froze, her phone flashlight pointed at the ground. It looked like another woman. And she seemed to notice Stephanie, who was still frozen. The woman slowly reached their arm into their harness, and pulled out a bulky, silver revolver. Stephanie couldn't see their face, but she could see the colour of their clothes. Purple. Slowly, the woman approached Stephanie, holding the revolver up, aiming it at Stephanie's forehead. "Don't move." The mystery woman said, her boots thumping along the ground. "Hands up, aswell." She added. Stephanie did as she was told, and raised her hands, her flashlight pointing up into the sky. The mystery woman pulled out her own flashlight, and shone it at Stephanie. She flinched, despite having aviators on. And that was when she finally got a look at the woman's face. A plume of brown hair covered the right side (Stephanie's left) of the girl's face, and a pair of sharp scars tore their way up her jaw to her cheek. Her only visible eye was coloured like wine. And she couldn't help but think...she was *really* pretty... \
"Please tell me you're not the one who just did that." The girl said, indicating the corpse. "Uh-" Stephanie sputtered, reeling herself back into the moment. "No. I didn't. I don't have a gun. Or- or a weapon, of any kind." She said. The woman took a step closer, and Stephanie flinched again. "I swear!" She sputtered, "My name's Stephanie! Stephanie Layton! I'm 23!" The woman smiled, "Yeah, yeah. Alright. Well..." She cocked her head to the side, "You haven't shot me yet. Could you...at least empty out your pockets? And that satchel?" She asked. Stephanie nodded slowly, and did as she was told. She opened up her satchel and went through every bit of space in there, showing the woman. And then she emptied her pockets. "...Okay. Thanks." The woman said, lowering the revolver. She twirled it around and slid it back into its holster on her harness. "Sorry about that. I'm Cisila Siveta."
