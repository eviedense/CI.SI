#### endless fight - Yakuza 5 - SEGA SOUND TEAM

Her entire body had gone numb. She had lost all feeling. Around her, the bright lights flashed and the crowd around her cheered and leered, as she fell back against the high-tension ropes around the ring. Her back pressing into it, Stephanie weakly raised her hand to her lip and wiped blood from it. She was struggling to stand. Her opponent at the other end of the ring cracked their neck from side to side, still full of energy. Stephanie herself was covered in bruises and cuts, and her gloves were starting to fall apart. Her tanktop was drenched in sweat, that of which also rolled down her forehead as she pulled herself back up slowly, limping. The fighting ring was flooded in blue, purple and pink lights. Surrounding it, there were sets of bleachers raised above it so the onlookers could see every detail of the fight. As she stood back up properly, shaking her head, Stephanie's hair caught the light. Her bright hot pink hair, the black roots of her hair, and her thin face. Her hair was a mess, and it barely reached her shoulders, where it wrapped around her neck. She had ear piercings and eyeshadow on, but because of the intense situation it was in, the eyeshadow was starting to mix with her sweat and disappear slowly. Stephanie blinked slowly, scrunching her eyes shut before opening them wide. Her opponent was waiting for her to get back into the zone, and she obliged, slowly raising her fists again. Her bare arms were bandaged up from previous injuries, and it looked like she had been fighting all night. Stephanie, by this point, was on her last legs. But this next opponent couldn't stop her, surely. As they stepped towards her, Stephanie went in for a jab at their stomach, but they grabbed onto her arm and bashed her away. Stumbling backwards, Stephanie shook her head and, instead of going in for another punch, whipped around and raised her leg up, kicking her opponent in the face. A powerful *crunch* came from the opponent's face as her foot made contact, and their head whipped to the right. Using her brief opportunity, she went in for a three-step combo. A jab to the stomach, and then an uppercut into the jaw, followed up by a kick to the stomach, sending her opponent skidding away. Grunting, they let out a yell and rushed at Stephanie. *FUCK!* Her mind screamed, and she barely ducked out of the way, instead letting her opponent smash right into the high-tension ropes, which bounced them back. Thinking she had a moment to attack, Stephanie went in for a heavy punch to her opponent's face, but she got caught first as the opponent knocked her arm out of the way and bashed her in the face. Spitting blood out of her mouth, Stephanie returned the punch as hard as she could. It didn't do much, and the two started trading blows. Each hit made Stephanie feel even more numb than before. And it kept getting worse. She stopped feeling everything. Her opponent's fist went straight into her cheek and she felt her arms drop to her sides. 

The crowd's cheering got even louder, before it started to fade away. Everything went fuzzy around her. Stephanie didn't even feel it when she hit the floor, because she had already gone unconscious.

It felt like only a brief moment before she felt someone prodding her cheek. Stephanie felt herself wake back up, and she slowly opened her eyes. *"Ugh...*" She mumbled, raising her head a little to look up at who was above her. Making a 'tch' sound, she let her drop back down, dejected. It was just Maria, her sister. She had been there to watch Stephanie fight again. "Hey..." Stephanie heard Maria say, through her buzzing ears. "Hey. Steph." Maria repeated. She grunted a response and refused to move, shutting her eyes again. It was only now she felt her entire body in pain. Stephanie let out a deep sigh and finally spoke properly. "Maria..." She mumbled, "Can you...not?" \
Stephanie slowly opened her eyes once more and looked up at Maria, and finally noticed that she wasn't lying in the ring. "Not what?" Maria said, pulling Stephanie up from the bench she was lying on, and sitting next to her. They were in one of the back rooms of the fighting club, and the lights were a bright, painful white, which reflected off of the metal sinks bolted to the walls. Stephanie had no idea who actually *used* those sinks, but there were a lot of them in the back rooms. She frowned and looked at Maria, "I mean..." Stephanie muttered, "quit *following* me here. I don't know what you're trying to do." She wiped her lip again, before Maria handed her a towel. Taking it, she dried her face. "You always end up like that." Maria stated, "Mom always gets worried. Tries to call you, only for you to end up in the hospital in the morning without a word." She pushed her black hair out of her eyes and sighed, adjusting her sunglasses- which, for some reason, she was wearing indoors. But Stephanie tended to do that aswell, so she couldn't judge. Maria was wearing her black jacket aswell as her favourite pair of worn blue jeans. Stephanie was dressed in her fighting ring getup: Her grey tanktop, and a pair of black cargo pants, and a worn pair of runners. "I don't care what Mom thinks." Steph said, lowering the towel. "She doesn't even like me." She sighed, "so why does she care so fucking much about my safety?" \
Maria stared at her for a moment, blinking behind her sunglasses. "Uh- er..." She mumbled, "I dunno." Stephanie rolled her eyes and slowly got up. She slowly limped over to the lockers on the other side of the room, and pulled her own one opening after fumbling with the lock. Slowly, she changed into her usual outfit. A jacket made with a mix of cotton, fabric and leather. The leather was almost like an accent, while the cotton and fabric made up the main part of the jacket. It was quite soft, but firm. Like her hair, the jacket's colours were hot pink and black. It was an equal amount of pink and black, so as to not overdo the colours. She'd had it made for her personally, and as she pulled it on, she slowly buttoned it up. The collar was rather large, and she flipped it up. She changed her cargo pants into a pair of pristine black jeans, and swapped out her runners with hiking boots, coloured grey. "Just go back home, Maria..." Stephanie said, rubbing her eyes. "I'll be back soon." \
Maria took a moment to respond, as she was looking down at her hands. "Huh?" She sputtered, looking up. "S-sorry, yeah...yeah, I'll go. Yeah." Maria mumbled, getting up slowly and heading towards the exit of the back room. Before she pulled open the door, Maria looked back at Stephanie, who was just sliding her sunglasses over her eyes. They were frameless, thin, and had side shields with a sleek and compact weave design, which completely hid her eyes from view. "Steph..." Maria said, adjusting her own glasses. Stephanie didn't respond, and instead pulled her satchel over her shoulder. "Steph." Maria repeated. "...Huh?" Stephanie muttered, looking up at Maria. "Steph- you..." Maria bit her lip uncomfortably, and she fumbled with the door handle, trying to find the right words to say. "Mom doesn't..." she paused again, letting out a deep breath. Maria looked nervous. "Mom doesn't...want you home today." She finally said, after a couple seconds of awkward silence. \
"W- what?" Stephanie asked, raising an eyebrow. "Why not?" Maria silently stared at her for a moment, before shaking her head. "She didn't tell me why. She just...she just told me..." she mumbled, trailing off. Stephanie felt her emotions fade away for a moment, as she was left confused. "What- I..." She stuttered, "I don't-...why?" Stephanie asked again, her eyes wide behind her sunglasses. Maria ignored her, and instead pulled the door open, and stepped out. She left Stephanie standing in the empty backroom, staring at the door. 

There wasn't much Stephanie felt anymore, but it was like a switch had flipped in her head. She knew exactly why her mother didn't want her home. And that meant she'd finally made up her mind. Sighing deeply, Stephanie turned away from the main exit and headed towards the other door on the opposite end of the room. Opening it with a key and stepping through into the main club, she fought to keep her tears back. *Deep breaths.* She thought. *Deep. Breaths.* \
Her mother no longer considered her her family. And that also meant she was no longer a girl to her mother, either. Stephanie knew that her mother wouldn't want to be near her after she'd finally come out, but she just couldn't understand why her mother still thought she was a boy. It had been years of work, and she felt confident in herself. She pushed her thoughts away as she made her way along the empty club floor. The entire club was a conglomerate of all sorts, she remembered, trying to take her mind off of things. The fighting ring she'd fight in was only a side part to the main nightclub, which had a bar attached. It was called *La Lune Brillante*, or *The Bright Moon* in English. It was where she spent most of her time. Walking across the empty club floor, she looked upwards at the DJ booth and the second floor. Stephanie had never been up there...maybe, next time she came, she'd check it out. Not like she'd have much better to do...shaking her head, she walked over to the entrance and pushed the two old doors open, stepping out into the abandoned subway tunnel that the club had been built in. There was graffiti and makeshift lights set up to make the tunnel more welcoming, but it still gave Stephanie the creeps. The subway tunnel had been closed for decades, ever since 2003. She knew it was related to a horrible accident one of the subway trains had found itself in, and one of the exits was blocked completely, a building collapsed over it. The local city council had elected to completely rebuild the subway system's underground tunnels, while favouring the L Train system to keep traffic under control. Heading down the tunnel, Stephanie found a ladder to climb up that she knew ended up in an empty street that nobody went to. She gripped onto the ladder, and began to pull herself upwards. Each step she took up the ladder made an echoing *clang,* bouncing off the tunnel walls. After a brief climb, Stephanie pushed the manhole cover out of the way and pulled herself up onto an empty street, where the only lights were street lights, that of which flickered on and off. Their bulbs had been replaced by the club staff, so instead of a warm orange, the street lights shone purple down on the street. Pulling her phone out of her jacket's pocket, Stephanie looked at her messages, of which she had a few. Her friends were wondering where she was again...and why she hadn't shown up to their party. Uninterested in responding, and too overwhelmed to do anything more, Stephanie put her phone away and headed down an alleyway between two buildings. She could probably sneak back into her room in her mother's house and lock the door, but that would likely only work for one night. And there was *still* the walk home. As she walked through the alleyway, the darkness seemed to swallow her briefly, no lights near enough to send any light into the alleyway. She continued to walk, and walk along the alleyway. When, suddenly...

Something meaty crunched underneath her foot. A bone snapped. "What th-" Stephanie sputtered, stumbling back. She quickly pulled out her phone and turned on its flashlight, and nearly screamed. A man was slumped against the wall, filled with bullet and knife wounds. *A murder...* \
It took her a moment to notice, but when did, she almost threw up. There was a large hole torn out from his chest, where his heart was. *Was.* She thought. *It...doesn't look like it's there anymore.* She kneeled down next to the man slowly and tried to see if he had any belongings still on him. Stephanie wasn't one to help too often, but it felt warranted that she at least tried to find out who the man was. Nobody else had found him, including the police, which meant that she would be a sole witness. But what she didn't consider as she stood up, was that she could be a suspect aswell. Something she missed was that being found next to a body was very damning.

And as she turned away from the body, she noticed a figure step into the alleyway. Stephanie froze, her phone flashlight pointed at the ground. It looked like another woman. And she seemed to notice Stephanie, who was still frozen. The woman slowly reached their arm into their harness, and pulled out a bulky, silver revolver. Stephanie couldn't see their face, but she could see the colour of their clothes. Purple. Slowly, the woman approached Stephanie, holding the revolver up, aiming it at Stephanie's forehead. "Don't move." The mystery woman said, her boots thumping along the ground. "Hands up, aswell." She added. Stephanie did as she was told, and raised her hands, her flashlight pointing up into the sky. The mystery woman pulled out her own flashlight, and shone it at Stephanie. She flinched, despite having aviators on. And that was when she finally got a look at the woman's face. A plume of brown hair covered the right side (Stephanie's left) of the girl's face, and a pair of sharp scars tore their way up her jaw to her cheek. Her only visible eye was coloured like wine. And she couldn't help but think...she was *really* pretty... \
"Please tell me you're not the one who just did that." The girl said, indicating the corpse. "Uh-" Stephanie sputtered, reeling herself back into the moment. "No. I didn't. I don't have a gun. Or- or a weapon, of any kind." She said. The woman took a step closer, and Stephanie flinched again. "I swear!" She sputtered, "My name's Stephanie! Stephanie Layton! I'm 23!" The woman smiled, "Yeah, yeah. Alright. Well..." She cocked her head to the side, "You haven't shot me yet. Could you...at least empty out your pockets? And that satchel?" She asked. Stephanie nodded slowly, and did as she was told. She opened up her satchel and went through every bit of space in there, showing the woman. And then she emptied her pockets. "...Okay. Thanks." The woman said, lowering the revolver. She twirled it around and slid it back into its holster on her harness. "Sorry about that. I'm Cisila Siveta. A detective."

There was only one thing rattling around in Stephanie's mind now.

*She's so pretty. And her voice is so beautiful.* \
Stephanie had to shake her head to pull herself back into the conversation, but she was ready to tell this detective whatever she needed.

Walking into Siveta's office, Stephanie slowly sat down on a squishy couch, which sat in front of Siveta's desk. Siveta herself sat down and leaned back in her chair, stretching. She grumbled, before leaning forward, and placing her face into her hands. "Okay..." She muttered through her hands. "So, you found that body there. Like that. And you stepped on the guy's hand?" Stephanie nodded, before remembering Cisila wasn't looking at her. "Er- yes." She said. "Right...okay," Cisila mumbled, pulling her face out of her hands. She pulled the man's ID out of her pocket and held it up. "It was just...some guy." She said. "But his heart was missing." She examined the ID carefully, turning it over. "I was hired to follow a case, and it seems like this guy was the next victim. The killing is always identical, with a person's heart ripped out. But there's something different about it." Stephanie pulled her sunglasses off and raised an eyebrow. "How?" She asked. "There were no bullet wounds or knife wounds on the previous killings." Cisila said. She bit her lip in confusion and put the card down, "Oh, by the way..." she said, looking at Stephanie. "What were you doing out there?" She asked. Stephanie's eyes went a little wide, "Uh...I was just heading home. G-Got caught there by you." She felt extremely nervous every time she spoke. "Alright." Cisila sighed, and she pulled out a notebook, picking up a pen. She began to note stuff down. "Can you give me your phone number?" Cisila said, looking at Stephanie over the notebook. "Uh...why?!" Stephanie sputtered. Cisila's brow furrowed and she looked a little annoyed. Sighing, she began to explain. "Each person who's found one of the victims - which is what I've always gone off of - have disappeared shortly thereafter." She said. "No bodies. I don't know if they died or not. If it's okay with you, I'd like to keep in contact, just to make sure you don't disappear." *I'm sure Mom would love for that to happen.* Stephanie thought, frowning. But the prospect of having this really pretty girl continue to talk to her was too good to pass up. "Yes- yes. Uh- of course." Stephanie stuttered, nodding. "Okay." Cisila frowned, putting her notebook down. She picked up her phone, and her brow furrowed more as she looked at it. Her expression briefly switched from her firm blankness to sadness, before she pulled the facade back up. Putting her phone down, Cisila looked back at Stephanie. "Are you...gonna leave?" She asked, eyeing Stephanie. "Um- yeah. Yeah. I'll go." Stephanie said, getting up. She shook her wrists out and walked towards the door. The office was drowning in a warm orange light, and most of the furniture looked old. It didn't look like Cisila was the one who had put everything up...or at least, Stephanie guessed so, from what little she knew about the pretty lady. *Ugh. Quit it.* She thought, trying to push her thoughts out of her head. But she couldn't, and as she got to the door, she looked back, and couldn't help herself. "Hey- um-" Stephanie blurted, "You're really pretty!" \
Cisila stared at her with confusion etched into her face. Her mouth was open a little. She blinked, and didn't say anything. Stephanie just stayed there, frozen. "You're...you're not too bad yourself." Cisila said, looking down at her desk. She looked sad. Stephanie decided to try and probe her. "...Something up?" Stephanie asked. Cisila looked up slowly, "Uh- yeah...a lot...but that's not your problem." She sighed. Stephanie let go of the door handle and turned towards Cisila, "It isn't good to keep your feelings all bottled up, y'know." She said. Cisila looked up at her and frowned again. "I hardly know you. I don't think I should...speak about my relationship problems to someone I met standing next to a corpse." 

"But-" Stephanie tried to say.

"...Out. Please." Cisila said. She sounded tired, and she put her face in her hands again. Stephanie relented, and opened the door.

*I wonder what's wrong.* She thought, stepping out into the hallway. Now all she had to do was sneak back into her room, at home.

Cisila pulled her face out of her hands again and picked up her phone. She opened the contacts and quickly found Lyla's number. While she was trying to get everything she could out of that Stephanie girl, Lyla had sent a message: *Sorry to be abrupt, but it looks like I need to leave for a little while. A month, at least. I know I don't like it, but for now, our relationship is on hold.* She had written. Calling Lyla, she held the phone up to the side of her head. "Lyla..." Cisila said, spinning around in her chair to face the shelves behind her. "Yeah- yeah, I'm sorry." Lyla said. "It's really important. I'm really sorry." She sighed, "I haven't been able to do much recently, and it's...well, it's part of why I'm going. I didn't want to keep dragging you on and on, so..." She paused. "Yeah- I...I think we've just gotta...stop. For now." Cisila leaned back in her chair and sighed deeply, fidgeting with a large coin she'd found. "It's- it's fine." Cisila said. "I get it." She didn't really get it. Lyla, for whatever reason, suddenly had so many trips to random places. And this was probably the worst of them. A month of not having Lyla was like a month where Cisila didn't have a purpose in life. "I'm...really going to be alone, though." She admitted. "You'll be alright..." Lyla said. "There's...there's a lot of people to talk to." Lyla sounded extremely tired, barely able to string words together. Cisila didn't want to make her more tired, so she decided to try and end the conversation as soon as she could. "Well, I...I won't *die* without you." Cisila said, "But...I also...I really can't guarantee that I won't..." she sighed. "I think I know what you mean." Lyla said. "Look- if...if you need someone...if you decide you like someone else..." She paused. Cisila fidgeted with the coin more, her fingers tensing up. Her fingers rubbed against the warm metal of the coin. "Lyla..." Cisila mumbled. "What's wrong?" \
Lyla breathed in deeply. "It's- it's nothing. I'm just...it might not take just a month. I could be gone for a lot longer, and I..." she paused again. "I just want you to be happy, so if there's...someone else you're happy with, that's- that's cool." She muttered. "Right..." Cisila said, feeling down. "Thank you." Lyla sighed, and finally finished the conversation. "Look- I love you. But I'm going to be gone for so long, and I..." Cisila raised an eyebrow in confusion, before Lyla suddenly dropped a bomb. "I might not come back." Lyla said. "What?" Cisila said, her expression going from the numb sadness she was feeling to worry. Confusion. "Lyla- what?" She repeated. "Lyla, what the fuck do you mean?! You-" But she was met with the beep of a hang up. She was left sitting in her chair with the phone up to her ear, frozen. *What does she mean?* Her mind echoed. *What could that possibly mean? Is she going to...die? Where even is she to begin with?* Cisila hadn't seen Lyla all week.

Worry sudden overtook her. She put her phone down, and got up from her chair. Lyla hadn't shown up in a week, and that enough had made her worry a little. But now it was bad. Lyla had basically said she could die. This wasn't a normal trip. This wasn't for Lyla's job. It wasn't even for family, or vacation...it was something else altogether. And it was like Lyla was telling her to find someone else so she wouldn't wait for a dead Lyla to return. Why? *Why* was this happening? What had Lyla been up to? She knew that only two years ago, she had been working under threat of blackmail for Cisila's ex-boyfriend, Mikhail. It was Lyla who had given her the scars on her cheek. Lyla had been through so much, and for her to up and disappear was strange. She wouldn't do that...not voluntarily. At least, Cisila *thought* she wouldn't. Surely. But it seemed like Lyla...Lyla was already gone. And she couldn't stop Lyla from leaving. Beginning to pace around the small office, Cisila couldn't push the worry out of her head. *What happened? What happened?* The question bounced around in her head, and she wasn't able to stop it. *Breathe!* She reminded herself, and she began to slow down. *Breathe.* She repeated. *It's fine. There's nothing you can do, which means there's no reason to freak out over it.* Despite this being a terrible fact, it did calm her down. *Okay.* She thought. *You need to turn your head back to the case at hand.* And with that, Cisila slowly sat back down at her desk and began to pour over everything she had already gathered on the crime, looking for details she may have missed. Pulling out pictures of the murder sites, she laid them all out on her desk. Each site was different, and including the one she'd just found, courtesy of the Stephanie girl, there were six. Six different people, murdered. Cisila was unable to find any relation between the murder victims, aside from two. The first one was a vice president of a medical company, and had been visiting Chicago for a press meeting. The murderer had caught him going to his hotel after the press meeting ended, and killed him in the alleyway, stealing his heart. The fourth victim, the only one related, was a scientist from the same medical company. The company, named Sakura Medical, was developing some kind of drug, which the vice president and the scientist had both been connected to, but Cisila was unable to find any other connections. It seemed like the murderer just wanted to inconvenience this drug, which was marketed as a sleep assistant, so Cisila couldn't really see a problem with it. And as far as she was concerned, the rest of the victims had no connections between each other. 

Each site was picked randomly, it seemed, on the night of the murder. In the first victim's case, it had been the alleyway. In the second victim's case, it had been an empty park. Places where there was nobody, at times where the murderer couldn't be seen. It was standard. Cisila had only been able to get to the crime scenes after the police had - aside from the newest victim, whom she had yet to look at the wallet and phone she'd taken - and wasn't able to get any evidence. There was no way for her to go through the victim's phones to find out what they were doing, nor could she look at CCTV footage. All of it had been admitted into police evidence...aside from the two things she'd taken from the newest victim. She set down the wallet and phone of the victim on her desk, and stared at the man's ID card again. *Mason Lard*, it read. He was thirty when he died, judging from his birthdate. She slowly went through the wallet, pulling out a credit card (which she avoided using), coupons, and a card belonging to a company. *Ah.* She thought. *Here we go. Something of use.* Cisila read the name on the card, and made a mental note of it. *Carbine Industries,* it read. She'd take a look at the company later, after she got some sleep. It was futile to try and find a connection between the victims, if there was even any, aside from the two Sakura Medical employees, but Cisila couldn't stop herself. Until she found out for sure that there was no connection, she would keep trying to find one. And the best way to do that, unfortunately, was to go to the police. But her client strongly disagreed with going to the police, and as she had put it, *"If you have to, break in and steal the evidence. They can't know."* she had said. Cisila would have to either go against her client's wishes, or break into the police HQ. For the third time in her life. Coming to this realization, she leaned back in her chair, and sighed. *Though, there is something else I could do.* She thought, but she already knew it wasn't a good idea. *I could wait for another murder. I could be there when it happens.* But *how* would she do such a thing? When? Cisila had no idea if or when another murder would happen, and a detective who sat around waiting for another murder to happen wasn't a very useful detective. *Maybe Kasey would help...* She thought, reaching for her phone. But she stopped. *I don't want to bug her.* She lowered her hand. *Kasey's on vacation, seeing her old friends. I don't want to drag her into this.* Shaking her head, Cisila put her face into her hands once more. *There's got to be something I can do. Surely.* \
But as she thought harder and harder, Cisila realized she really couldn't avoid breaking into the police station. She needed details that only the police had, including the murderer's appearance. The victim's wallets and phones. She *needed* them to continue her investigation, and without them, it would come to a grinding halt. Her client's money wasted. 

*But...there's somewhere else I can go.* She realized. *Somewhere I've never been. Somewhere I know I can get information.*

*Will it really work though?* She thought, frowning. Cisila wasn't even sure she could get into the place, and decided not to worry about it for now. There was ample time, surely. \
Cisila slowly pulled out something from one of her pockets, turning it around in her hands. It resembled an inhaler, but had a more industrial design, aswell as a more bright colour scheme than most commercial inhalers, consisting of black as its main colour, neon yellow-green as a secondary, and meager, desaturated purple. Its logo, and name, *HAZE,* was emblazoned on the main cylinder part of the inhaler-like device, in bright purple. A piece of tape wrapped around the top of the cylinder, reading *Don't die. - T*. Staring at the inhaler made her mind feel heavy. Even heavier, now that the odd disapperance of Lyla and the abrupt, yet temporary, halt of the investigation were weighing down on her. Putting the mouthpiece to her lips, Cisila used her pointer and middle finger to press down on the top of the inhaler, and felt the haze enter her mouth. Out of what looked like miniature pressure valves embedded into the inhaler, the haze flushed out with a quiet *hiss*, briefly being visible before it evaporated. Everything around her warped, turning a deep purple, before doubling up. And then tripling up. Her brain felt like it was floating in space, and briefly, wooziness drowned her, making her feel as though she was going to collapse. Everything around her was a mess, tripled up and coated in bright purple for a brief moment, but to her, it felt like an eternity. Everything had slowed to a crawl from her eyes, while her inner voice and mind's eye faded away. \
It may have been quiet, but there was another voice. A different voice. It whispered something as the purple hue faded away, and her vision returned to normal. She blinked. \
*Whoever took her...whatever they've done,* The voice whispered, *They die. Nobody touches her.* \
She couldn't help but agree, despite how bad the idea made her felt. \
Cisila didn't do that, right? Not to anyone who didn't deserve it. And nobody did...except for the worst of the worst. And if Lyla truly had been taken against her will, by people that had no morality...perhaps they did deserve it. Perhaps, as she wondered in the deepest part of her mind, they deserved to be torn apart.

#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23

As quietly as she could, Stephanie climbed up the roof of her mother's two story suburban home. Stephanie's room was on the second floor, and she knew her window was unlocked. Tip-toeing across the damp, shingled roof, Stephanie pulled open the window to her room. It slid upwards with a horrible grinding noise, which she tried to keep as quiet as she could. *Fuuuck.* She thought, climbing in slowly. Setting her feet down on the floor as quietly as she could, Stephanie slid her shoes off. The less noise she made, the better. Her mother certainly didn't want to see her...and at this rate, Stephanie wanted to see her even less. Looking around her room, Stephanie lifted her sunglasses up. All she needed was her laptop, water bottle, and a couple of books. And then she would leave. Her job would support her and...she was *pretty* sure a couple of her friends would let her stay with them. But right now...all Stephanie needed to focus on was pretending not to exist. Tip-toeing across her room, she picked up her laptop from her desk. Her room was painted in boyish colours, which she had always disliked. Red walls. Her dad's memorabilia that she had inherited was strewn across the walls. Posters of soccer players, baseball players, and old vintage movies. It was her dad's way of helping her- hiding her true interests from her mother. Her dad always loved her, despite her mother's insistence on not treating her like a human being. He knew her mother was a bad person, and tried to help Stephanie as much as she could. He was part of why she looked like how she felt now. Sliding her laptop slowly into her satchel, she went to pick up her water bottle. It was plastered in stickers, and looking at it, she frowned. It was really her only belonging that showed her true interests, and it was battered. It had been dented, which wasn't there yesterday morning. Sighing and quietly putting it into her satchel, Stephanie pulled her notebooks off of her desk aswell and slid them into her satchel, along with her pencil case. Looking around her room again, she tried to think if she needed anything else. Frowning at the pictures on her bedside table, she decided that, no, she didn't need anything else. There wasn't anything that really belonged to her here that she couldn't buy again if she needed it. There wasn't really anyone she wanted to see before leaving, either. Maria had clearly been manipulated by her mother in order to actually tell Stephanie not to come back. Slowly making her way towards the window again, and about to put her shoes on, Stephanie heard a noise, and her entire body froze involuntarily. It was the click of the door knob moving. Slowly, the door to her room opened with a subtle creak. Light from the outside hallway flooded in, like water filling up a tank. A tank Stephanie would end up drowning in if she stayed too long. She forcefully slid her shoes on, and winced, her heels grinding against the back of the shoes. She reached towards the window, about to climb out, when a voice stopped her. 

"...Did Maria not tell you, or are you *fucking* deaf?" Her mother hissed from the entrance of her room. She sounded angry. Angrier than usual. Stephanie didn't move her head, but she did pull her sunglasses back over her eyes. The light made her eyes water. Her eyes were much, *much* too sensitive. Maria's were, too. "Hey." Her mother said. "*Are* you deaf? I know you can hear me." Stephanie slowly turned her head to look back at her mother's silhouette, shrouded in light. "I was just leaving." Stephanie muttered. "And I *told* you-" Her mother began, "Well, told *Maria-* that you weren't to come the fuck back." Stephanie sighed, and her mother took a step forward. "Don't give me that attitude." She hissed, "I don't know what's fucking gotten into you, but I've had enough." *Stephanie* was the one who had had enough. She let go of the window, and turned to face her mother aggressively. If she was leaving, then whatever she said next wouldn't matter. After years of torment from this woman, she could finally let it out. Stephanie stared into her mother's eyes. Her mother's hair was frazzled, brown, tied into a ponytail. Her face, like Stephanie's, was thin. But she looked gaunt compared to Stephanie. Anger was etched across her mother's face, as it always seemed to be when she looked at Stephanie. As she stared, her mother backpedaled a bit, taking a step back. "Shut the fuck up." Stephanie hissed. "*Shut. The fuck. Up.*" She repeated. Her mother's expression went from anger, to shock. "*What-*" She grunted, "You're not allowed to talk to me like that, you goddamn-" Stephanie cut her off again. She would *not* let her mother insult her again. "I told you to *shut* the *fuck* up, Mom." She began, "I probably shouldn't even call you that. You're just a goddamned piece of shit, and I'm tired of pretending you aren't." She flung her arms out, "It's always 'fuck off' this, 'buy us dinner' that!" Her mother recoiled, taking yet another step back. "What the hell am I to you, even? I don't get it." \
Her mother cocked her head to the side and raised her voice. "You're- you're a goddamn *freak*. That's what you are." She spat, "I don't know what happened to you. I don't know why you felt like you had to be a girl, but I still- I still look at you, and see my boy. My real child. What happened to that? Huh?" Her mother took hold of the conversation and took a step forward. "Why do you feel the need to disrespect me just because I don't think you're a fucking girl? You're dillusional." She started to go on a spiel of why Stephanie was wrong, and why she, her *mother,* was right. Stephanie just watched in shock as she continued to say ridiculous things...things that weren't true. But she couldn't stop her mother. "...And then suddenly, after *all* of that, you come up to me-" Her mother pointed to herself, and raised her voice even louder. "And you tell me YOU THINK YOU'RE A GIRL?!" She shrieked. Stephanie had backed up against the window, and she was shaking. She thought she had the energy to overpower her mother, but the overpowering voice of her mother had proven otherwise. "YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT? YOU EXPECT ME TO BE *OKAY* WITH THAT?" Her mother continued to shriek. "I JUST WANT YOU *OUT.* AND YOU'RE STILL DISOBEYING ME? AFTER ALL THIS FUCKING TIME? AFTER *ALL* I'VE FUCKING PUT UP WITH?" Stephanie felt her heartrate increasing, and her breathing getting faster. Her grip on the window sill was tightening, her knuckles turning white. Her mother finally stopped, her face red. Stephanie stared into her mother's malicious eyes. Blinking, Stephanie realized this was her chance. This was her only chance. "I AM *DONE* PUTTING UP WITH THIS." Her mother shrieked again, "I-" But the next time her mother opened her mouth, Stephanie overtook her. "**I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!**" She yelled in her mother's face. Her breathing had gotten heavier. "WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?" She began to shake harder as she let go of the window, "WHY IS IT SUCH A BIG DEAL WHEN I CHOOSE A WAY TO LIVE? IT'S NOT *YOUR* LIFE." Her mother stared at her. "You're right." Her mother said. "It's not my life." She cocked her head to the side, "But you're my child. Or are you? I can't fucking tell. The boy I gave birth to has disintegrated, and this pink...this pink and black- *abomination* has appeared in his place." She hissed. Stephanie opened her mouth to say something, but couldn't find the words. "I'm done." Her mother said. "I'm done listening to your excuses. Get out." 

Stephanie's mind had gone numb, like it had in the fighting ring. Her anger clouded her thoughts, and there was only one thing her mind was thinking. *Punch her. Punch her. She deserves it, doesn't she? Punch her.* Her mother continued to stare at her, waiting for Stephanie to walk past her quietly and obediently. But she didn't. Instead, in one swift movement, Stephanie went in for an uppercut. All of her strength went into it, but...her mother stopped it. In a surprising showcase of strength, her mother caught Stephanie's uppercut before her fist slammed into her mother's chin. Making a small squeak from surprise, Stephanie began to struggle. Her mother turned Stephanie around forcefully and shoved her towards the entrance of the door. "*Leave.*" Her mother hissed. Stephanie looked at her mother. "No." Stephanie protested. "I'm not going, no matter how much you tell me to. I'm *done* listening to y-" But she was stopped midsentence by her mother delivering a painful *slap* to her face. Stephanie's glasses flew off her face and clattered against the ground. Her thoughts faded away as she was left in the moment, in shock. Her mother had slapped her. \
As quickly as her mother could muster, she walked around Stephanie and slammed the door shut behind her. Stephanie stood there in silence, her mouth hanging open in disbelief. Slowly, she raised her hand to her cheek, feeling the sting from her mother's slap. It *hurt.* She'd never done that before. But...it was Stephanie's fault. She'd let her anger take over, and she'd almost broke her mother's jaw. In her defense, she couldn't stop herself. How could a parent treat their child like that? What was *so* wrong with Stephanie that her mother hated her very guts? Blinking back tears, Stephanie kneeled down and picked up her sunglasses, and slid them back over her nose. The dark lenses and side shields of the frameless glasses hid her eyes as tears began to well up. Walking over to the window slowly, she grabbed onto the window sill, extremely tightly. *Fuck.* She thought, letting go and punching the sill as hard as she could. It didn't make her feel better as her knuckles dug into the wood of the sill. It made her feel worse. She couldn't stop herself from crying as she climbed out of the window and slammed it shut. There was no reason to stay quiet. There was no reason to *care.* Her mother had loved her all the way up until Stephanie became a girl. And then it was insults, labour, and ignorance. *Why* did her mother have to be like this? Stephanie climbed down the roof and landed in front of the porch. Looking back, she saw her mother looking out from one of the living room windows, silhouetted. Stephanie couldn't see her expression, and her mother couldn't see her own. She sniffed, and cried harder, looking away. 

-

She sat on a bench in the middle of an empty park, scrolling on her phone. It was raining softly, and Stephanie kept having to wipe her screen off. Eventually, she turned her phone off and put it away. She pulled her glasses off and buried her face in her hands. *Fuck.* She thought.

# Investigation Begins
### CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, U.S.A
### 5:20PM, CST
### NOVEMBER 2ND, 2035
#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23

*Stephanie meets back up with Cisila after being attacked by the killer that Cisila has been investigating, and seeing that Stephanie is her only direct connection to this killer, Cisila proposes that they have to work together. Gleefully, Stephanie agrees. Cisila gives Stephanie a more in-depth overview of the case, showing the following: The pictures of the murder sites, the pictures of the victims before death, aswell as what they were doing just before they disappeared- something she doesn't know for all but one of the victims. Cisila explains that she needs the IDs, wallets, and any information on the victims, and all that information is currently in police evidence, which Cisila notes she can't get into, just like was mentioned last time we saw her. When Stephanie asks how Cisila is planning to get that information, Cisila explains that she learned from a friend (Kasey) that there is a club in Chicago. Stephanie raises an eyebrow, before being shocked by the name that comes out of Cisila's mouth. 'La Lune Brillante', the same one Stephanie fights in every other night. Upon hearing that this is where Stephanie had been just before finding the body, Cisila insists that the two go there the following night to find the informant she knows of. Whether or not he will give the information is an entirely different story, and something Stephanie immediately begins to worry about.*

*Swapping to Cisila's perspective as Stephanie takes her leave, we skip to the evening. She leaves the office to go on a walk after having an angry call with her client, where she had to explain that the investigation was on halt until she got her hands on the victims' information, as she needs to be able to make a connection to form some kind of modus operandi. As she rounds the corner into a shadowy park, she spots a figure watching her from a tree, leaning against it. And then, just as suddenly, her phone buzzes. Pulling it out, she sees a message from an unknown number. "Lyla is dead." It reads. It makes her go numb. "We killed her." She looks up at the figure, only for them to pull out their own phone and hold up a picture. Lyla. "We've gotten your attention." They say.* \
*It was hard enough to lose Dani, and she'd already dealt with that badly. But the sudden disappearance of Lyla and this- this punch to the gut- feels even worse. Approaching the figure, she slowly pulls out one of her revolvers, training it on the figure. They are cloaked in shadow, and wearing a hood. They remain frozen. She gets so close that the barrel of the revolver touches the forehead of the figure. Still, they do not move. Cisila almost pulls the trigger when the figure speaks again. "Is it the truth?" They speak, ominously. "If you want to find out, killing me only makes that harder." Slowly, she lowers her revolver, feeling her free hand twitching impulsively. The figure takes a few steps backwards, slowly putting their phone away. "You will see us again. And if you want the truth to what happened, then you do not touch us. You do not try to injure us.* \
*As the figure walks away, Cisila shoves her revolver back into its holster. "Who is 'us'?", she thinks. Why do they think they can dangle Lyla's fate over her? The message of her death is burned into her retinas, despite the fact that the figure seemed to suggest otherwise. Feeling herself go even more numb, Cisila knows that the next time she sees the figure in their distinct outfit, there will be no mercy. She's blinded. The voice in her head, caused by the Haze.* 

*Swapping back to Stephanie, she walks into her friend's house, Talin's, where she is currently staying. Only to find Talin holding a note and looking worried, and as she notices Stephanie, Talin quickly perks up and rushes over to her. She explains that she found this note taped to the front door after Stephanie left, and was wondering if she left it. Looking at the note, Stephanie denies this. She looks up at Talin, and says, after carefully reading it, that it was for Stephanie herself. Heading into her temporary room, she sits down and stares at the note. "The thing you Seek is in the fighting ring. Defeat the Man, and you will defeat the police's desperate attempts at a cover-up." Staring at the oddly written note, she wonders who would still write like this- in cursive. Putting it into her bag for later, Stephanie lies down on the mattress in her room: there is no frame for it. She sighs.*

# The Man From Korea
### CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, U.S.A
### 11:45PM, CST
### NOVEMBER 3RD, 2035
#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23 *&* CISILA J. SIVETA, 26

*Stephanie brings Cisila with her into the club, explaining the note she got. Cisila tells Stephanie of what happened to her aswell, revealing Lyla's existence. This somewhat disappoints Stephanie, knowing Cisila already has someone, but she can't help but feel bad. When Cisila says she thinks there may be a connection between this strange man and the note that Stephanie got, Stephanie disagress. It was probably just a coincidence, as the two have two completely different meanings: The note was aware of what Stephanie did in La Lune Brillante, aswell as the fact that she was participating in Cisila's investigation. The figure was purely focused on Cisila, and tormenting her. Slightly irritated, Cisila tells Stephanie they need to meet the informant and get the information from him. Stephanie points out that she knows of a man who deals in information, and always sits in one of the darker corners of the bar. As they head towards the bar, Stephanie can't help but keep staring at Cisila- not because she's pretty. Not this time. But because she seems to look worse than she did yesterday. Dark shadows under and around her eyes. "It's nothing." Cisila mutters. "I'm just tired." But Stephanie doesn't believe her, however she doesn't push the topic. Lyla's disappearance seems to have taken a toll on her, or so Stephanie thinks. They meet with the informant, a man who doesn't look American. He greets them and allows them to sit at his table, and he, rather politely, buys them drinks. Cisila looks at her own when it arrives, frowning. Stephanie gratefully takes it. He introduces himself as La Lune Brillante's informant, the 'Shadow of Shadows'. A man from Korea, he built his life upon information dealing, but he doesn't reveal why or how he ended up here, at La Lune Brillante. Instead, he quickly gets down to business, and explains what he needs from them in order to give Cisila the information she requires. Tonight, a man notorious for brutalizing his opponents is making an appearance in the ring. He is looking to finally be beaten after his streak of winning. The informant says that the man is merciless, but because of the rules of La Luna Brillante, won't kill his opponent. He stares at Stephanie, expectantly.* \
*Cisila looks at Stephanie, frowning. She doesn't think Stephanie has the guts. But Stephanie takes the man up on the offer, and he smiles. "Excellent," He says, reaching out a hand. He gives Stephanie his name. Han Daehyun. He informs her that the fight begins soon, and insists she go get ready. And that she does, and thirty minutes later, she climbs into the ring. Only to be met by...Han, again. He is wearing a jacket with no undershirt, revealing his chest and muscles. His jacket, made of reflective materials with an exquisite pattern, sparkles under the bright lights of the ring. He exudes elegance. Cue THEORY OF BEAUTY, for the fight against the Informant, Han Daehyun, a fight focused on showcasing Stephanie's ability to adapt in situations where she isn't in the know. Having to learn Han's moveset, Stephanie is forced to duck and dodge for the majority of the fight, wearing herself down. Han's uppercuts, jabs, and punches are quick, precise, and calculated. Stephanie overcomes him by taking advantage of a gap in his footwork, knocking him down and stomping on his face. This doesn't stop him, however, and the fight continues as Stephanie gains a standing against Han. Eventually, after taking several devastating hits, Stephanie takes out Han Daehyun.*

*Meanwhile, Cisila sits in the nightclub, watching the large dance floor. She's surprised, if annoyed, by the amount of people at the nightclub. The music is deafening, and the lights flash irritably. Feeling fed up, and unable to push herself out of the surroundings, she uses her Haze, inhaling the purple fumes. Her vision slurrs, everything doubling and then tripling up, warping. Shaking her head, she turns towards the dance floor in her seat, only to see someone standing in the middle of it. The deafening music fades away as her pupils dilate on the man that appeared in the park. He is standing in the middle of the dance floor, staring at her. Silent. Unmoving. Cisila, under the influence of the Haze, and unable to stop herself, slides out of her chair and begins to force her way through the ground. The purple hue of the Haze fades away, except from around her peripheral vision. Her eyes are locked on the cloaked figure, who seems so, so far away. Each step is agonizing, her rage building. They won't keep Lyla from her. They can't. They will tell her where she is. They will tell her what they did to Lyla. She keeps a tight grip on the hilt of her blade, which she has strapped to her belt. Cisila had a feeling she would need it. They won't taunt her like this. They won't get away with anything. Shoving people out of her way with her free arm, she gets close enough to the man to strike. Holding onto the sheathed blade with one hand, and sliding it out its sheathe with the other, she strikes. But the figure was ready. They whip out a knife and deflect Cisila's swing, stabbing her in the stomach, which she deflects just in time- but the figure slips away. And to her surprise, the whole crowd seems to have stopped what they were doing. The purple hue around her peripheral intensifies as she watches the figure step back and melt into the crowd of people...who start to morph. First, it's only a couple people. But then more. Each turn into the hooded figure. Trying to understand what happened, her brain urges her to take another shot of Haze. It will clear her mind. It will strengthen her. Everything becomes clearer to her. Every single person on this dance floor was the 'us' the figure mentioned. They were all around, all this time. Everyone is trying to keep it secret from her, no?* \
*She can't stop herself from stabbing the closest one. The lights flash even harder as the music suddenly floods back in, deep and bass heavy. Everything speeds back up as the dozens of hooded figures fight back against her. But she refuses to give up. No matter how hard they try to fight, each falls to the floor. More and more try to stop her, try to trick her into thinking they're not who they say they are...but they all fall to the floor, their blood coats her blade. She's made up her mind.*

*Meanwhile, Stephanie and Han Daehyun are sitting, back in their normal outfits, where Han congratulates her, and tells her that once they get back to Cisila, he will give them everything he knows- and explains that he too is rather interested in the case, and suggests that he be able to tag along. Stephanie agrees. But just as they get up to head back to Cisila, a deafening scream echoes from the dance floor. They rush to the dance floor...and Stephanie nearly has a heart attack. A cloaked figure is backing away from the dance floor as Cisila slices her way through the innocent people at the club, who are desperately trying to stop her. But her eyes...they seem to be glazed over. Han looks shocked, and quickly looked around. Stephanie rushes forward and tries to stop Cisila, only to get pulled away by Han. "She's not in her own mind." Han hisses, hiding behind the bar counter with her. "I knew it when she first stepped in here. She is using something..." The guards of La Lune Brillante eventually join the fray, but even they can't stop her. The entire dance floor is covered in blood, and by the time Cisila is done, there are bodies strewn around her. And the cloaked figure is gone. Stephanie, against Han's insistence, gets out of the hiding spot and confronts Cisila. Though she doesn't know it, the Haze is fading away from Cisila. She's regained some control...but not enough to stop her from attacking Stephanie. "They killed her." Cisila hisses. "You don't understand- and if you don't understand-" She twirls her blade around, aiming it at Stephanie. "Then you and I are done."* \
*Cue THROUGH for the fight against Cisila, from Stephanie's perspective. This is a normal fight, but pitting the main characters against each other isn't common to see in my writing. As the fight goes on, Stephanie's punches further decrease the Haze in Cisila's systems, and as the fight progresses through the club, they eventually find themselves outside, in the street, drenched by the rain outside. Lit by the pinkish-purple bulbs on the empty street lights, the fight eventually ends, and Cisila collapses. As does Stephanie. As Cisila regains controls of herself, she begins to hyper ventilate. Her vision returns to normal, as she realizes what she actually did. Han rushes outside and yells at the two that they need to leave. Rushing them away, Han takes them to a safehouse that he uses. Neither Han nor Stephanie saw Cisila use Haze, and are unaware of what caused her to go haywire.*

#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23 & CISILA J. SIVETA, 26

*Lying to the both of them, Cisila says she's unsure of what happened to her. She explains it as though she saw the figure, and her mind just switched off. Everything turned into an illusion. Stephanie and Han believe Cisila. Cisila says she's going to close up the case and refund her client- she can't focus on it anymore. But Stephanie disagrees. She argues that more people will die. Without someone to figure it out, the bodies will likely just keep piling up. But Cisila argues back that she still doesn't have what she needs, and turns her aggression on Han, who immediately shuts her down. "I have what you need." He explains. He makes Cisila a cup of tea, which, for the time being, calms her down and saps her of any anger. Laying out all the information Han has, Cisila compiles what she needs. Victim IDs, aside from Mason Lard's, the victim that Stephanie found. Their workplaces. And immediately, Cisila notices a trend. Each had a business card on them, and after pulling out her phone and doing a little bit of research, finds out that half of the victims are scientists and researchers for a pharmaceutical conglomerate. Stephanie does some of her own research, and sees that all traces of the victims' social media and opinions have just disappeared. Cisila thinks this could have been done by the murderer. Han explains that the phones of the victims disappeared, and were likely used for the purpose Cisila describes - the complete wiping of their existence online. Cisila wonders why this has been done...and can't find any answers yet. Stephanie suggests going straight to the pharma company, Equinox Medical, and asking what the researchers and scientists were doing, if anything. But Cisila shakes her head, and does some further research. Discovering papers by some of the scientists, she discovers that they were working on a series of drugs preemptively titled 'LHD-0404'. Perhaps they were murdered for working on this drug, Stephanie thinks. But as she tries to research it aswell, she can't find anything on the LHD-0404 series of drugs, not even what "LHD" means. Which is odd. Cisila tells her to put a stop to it, and they brainstorm reasons as to why there could be a murderer going around killing employees of Equinox Medical. Perhaps the murderer is against whatever the LHD-0404 does, and wiped all trace of it off of the internet. But the only way they could've done this is with direct access to Equinox's servers. They must have missed a couple of websites and news articles, which is what the two found. Han suggests that they look for another connection between the rest of the victims, which are Carbine Industries employees. Agreeing, Cisila and Stephanie turn to that, and repeat the process. They look at what Carbine Industries was doing around the time of the news articles for the LHD-0404, but can't find anything. They seem to be completely disconnected.*

*Cisila wonders if the cloaked figure could somehow be connected to all this. She privately hopes this is the case, as it would give her a valid reason to kill him. To find out why they took Lyla. After being attacked by the murderer themselves, Stephanie can't help but be invested in the investigation. And as she heads home, she feels tired. Collapsing in her bed, she passes out and wakes up the next morning, only to find Talin standing over her. Helping Stephanie up, Talin wants to know why Stephanie disappeared. Pushing her away, Stephanie says she can't explain why. This seems to hurt Talin. When Talin asks about Stephanie's mom, Stephanie snaps back with a bitterness in her voice that Talin has never heard before. Leaving the house, Stephanie leaves Talin in shock.* \
*Cisila has fallen back into bitterness, but doesn't back down from the investigation. Fueled by the vague idea that the figure might be connected, Cisila works feverishly to tie everything together, and to figure out her next step. Her best bet is to try and sneak into the Equinox Medical building in Chicago, and see if they're holding anything related to LHD-0404. Heading out, she ignores a message from Stephanie, explaining ideas she had.* \
*A few hours later, Stephanie's out in the town when she gets a message from Cisila. "Trapped inside Equinox Medical. Hiding. Need help." Stephanie panicks, and immediately calls Han. They quickly formulate a plan after Han criticizes Cisila for immediately going this far. Nonetheless, the two meet up and head for Equinox Medical. Roll back the clock...*

### NOVEMBER 4TH, 2035
#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 26

*Rolling back the clock to before Cisila calls for help, we see her sneak into the Equinox Medical building. She makes her way through the building, and getting into the underground parking garage, she spots a few researchers talking to what looks like members of the Syndicates. Noting this down, she sneaks into the elevators and gets hire up into the building. We see her search through computers that are on, file cabinets, and anything she can get her hands on, while avoiding anybody still in the building at this time.* \
*Suddenly, it seems like she was somehow spotted. She rushes to find a place to hide, and forces her way through a group of security guards, who open fire on her. Returning the fire using her revolvers, she ducks into a room and locks the door, and then quickly texts Stephanie.* \
*Swapping back to Stephanie, we see Han and her enter the building through the parking garage (via a suggestion by Han) and see the place swarmed with Syndicate members. Thinking (correctly) that the two are intruders, the Syndicate members engage the two. Cue GET THEM from Yakuza 0 for the first long battle from Stephanie's perspective with Han Daehyun by her side. The two fight their way through the Syndicates, but are unable to take all of them down. Their primary goal is to get to Cisila, and as the fight progresses, they get closer and closer to Cisila's location, as Stephanie has used her phone to pinpoint to origin of Cisila's message. Up, and up they go through the Equinox Medical building, fighting through the Syndicate. Han is puzzled by the fact that there are so many in the building- whatever Cisila must have found caused the Syndicate to gun for her- whichever Syndicate it is, which still isn't clear.*

*Finding Cisila, the three reconvene. Cisila quickly gives Stephanie the information that she seems to have found just after we swapped perspectives, and tells Stephanie to run for it with Han. Cisila herself needs a way out, and can't be seen with the evidence. Unable to ask why, Stephanie simply accepts, and leaves with Han, attempting to find a quieter way out than in via another door in the room Cisila was trapped in. Swapping to Cisila's perspective, cue T U S K as she confronts the group of Syndicate members waiting outside the main door. Instead of trying to escape, Cisila beats down the group and demands to see their leader. Taking a hit of Haze, the whole scenario becomes a blur. She knows where to go after being told by one of the members, and eventually finds what she's looking for as the Haze completely takes over. Dan. The Syndicate in question was the Cobras. Unable to think clearly, she latches onto Dan and demands to know what's happening. Her vision turns from warped purple to a burning red, as it intensifies. Her hand twitches. Dan's words fall on deaf ears, but before Cisila can take him out, she's shot in the shoulder. Looking back, she sees the cloaked figure. Her instincts shift to chase after the figure. The red gets even worse. The buzzing in her ears drones on as she chases after the cloaked figure, the same one that took Lyla. The same one that probably killed her. As she sprints through the hallways, she sees that the cloaked figure is about to jump through the window. Her mind dead set on following them, Cisila barely registers that the figure slides to a stop. Cisila flies past them, and as she cranes her head towards them, she sees something that nearly snaps her mind in two. The figure has pulled off their mask. It's Lyla looking at her in complete and total contempt. Cisila crashes straight through the large window, and plummets to the ground, barely saving herself with her EXO's grapple.*

#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23

*Regrouping at Cisila's office, Stephanie and Han look at what Cisila's found. She had gathered documents that seemed to pinpoint LHD-0404's origin. A Carbine Industries project that involved Equinox Medical. But it still didn't answer their question: what WAS LHD-0404, and why had those specific researchers been killed? Flipping through the rest of what Cisila gathered, they soon see why. One of them used to be a lead researcher on the LHD-0404 project, but was outspoken against it in the company. Stephanie feels her stomach twist as she pieces together that the man could've been killed because he was against it. Then she tries to find the others, and they too were also against LHD-0404. But still, no mention of what it is. All company papers have had the LHD-0404 project in blanked out text, aside from the name 'LHD-0404' and the researchers' opinions. As Cisila enters, wounded, the two quickly patch her up and explain to her what they found. Cisila bats them away, once again refocused on the cloaked figure, which seems to have been Lyla. But it confuses her to no end. She puts her foot down, and tells the two to let the investigation go. She is shutting it down, and refuses to continue it. The cloaked figure to her is much more important, much more worthy of her time. Subconsciously, Cisila pulls out the Haze inhaler and takes a hit. Stephanie watches in horror. So does Han. But the two oblige, and leave. On the way out, they discuss what the inhaler could've been. Han sees it clearly now: Cisila is on something, and it is causing her to see illusions. It must have been what happened at the club. But who gave her such a thing? What drug could DO such a thing?* \
*Stephanie frowns, before a wild idea forms in her head. It seems stupid. Looking at Han, she suggests, "What if that could be LHD-0404?". Han considers this for a moment, before replying, "If so, we need to learn what it does to the body. If it causes major illusions that cause you to kill, then I can see why the researchers were against it." Stephanie frowns, and sees that she's going to have to either steal the inhaler or convince Cisila to let her look at it for a brief moment. If it isn't connected to LHD-0404, so be it. But seeing her new friend in such a low place makes her feel bad- worse than her mother could ever make her feel. Heading home, Stephanie sits on the couch as Talin also arrives. She carries a bag into her room, and Stephanie gets a brief glance at something shoved into one of the pockets. It looked oddly familiar to the inhaler...* \
*Han, for the time being, bows out of being an active help in the case.* \
*Asking Talin later, she seems to panick a little bit. Stephanie calms her down before asking again, promising that she wouldn't tell anyone. Talin resists, saying that it's none of her business, but when Stephanie reveals what she saw in Talin's bag, and that it looked identical to something a friend had, Talin stops. She blinks, confused, before she opens her mouth and begins to explain quietly. It's a drug that she was given to her by the Dragons Syndicate in order to sell. And she does so, under threat of murder. Stephanie's usual calm expression is slowly warped into fear and worry as Talin explains that she sells the inhaler to anyone. Whoever wants it. Whatever stops her from being killed. By the end, Stephanie is horrified, and Talin leans back into the couch. "Not much of a choice..." Talin whispers, feeling herself break. Stephanie quietly asks if Talin knows what the drug really is, but she only responds with, "They call it Haze".*

*Talin, reminded of how she is on the brink of death if she doesn't sell enough of the Haze, slowly breaks down. Stephanie comforts her, unable to see anything wrong with what Talin is doing. She knows Talin is doing what she has to.*

#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23

Stephanie was sitting on Talin's couch, staring at the wall. The sun had gone down, and the lights in Talin's apartment were all off, leaving Stephanie sitting in the darkness. She had taken her sunglasses off, and without any strain being put on her eyes, she felt a lot better. The shadows of the apartment were calming, and it felt as though Stephanie could finally take a moment to breathe. Too much had happened in too short of a time. She still wasn't sure *what* was going on with Cisila, or why she had even done...what she did. The Haze may have been a reason, but what would drive a person to actually *act* on their thoughts? How bad did the Haze make that? Was it even the Haze? Sighing to herself, she leaned back, and shut her eyes. In addition to this, Stephanie hadn't heard from Maria since she'd left the house. Was she okay? Was her job fine? Stephanie always worried about Maria's wellbeing, especially whenever her mother didn't. It was important to her that Maria had a good life, something that Stephanie was beginning to think she couldn't have. Everything was too tiring. Everything was too difficult, and now this pressure that had come from Cisila and this odd investigation felt like a crushing weight, constantly pressing her down. She needed *something* to take her mind off of this. Anything would do. Anything at all to just make her forget the pressure for a moment. And, as if the universe heard her, Talin nearly kicked down her own door as she gleefully waltzed in. "Steeeph!" She said in a sing-song tone. Stephanie opened her eyes and stared at Talin. "...What's got you so excited?" Stephanie asked. "You'll love this." Talin replied, flopping down on the couch next to Stephanie, pulling out her phone. "I got word from a friend of mine that there's a street race happening tonight." She explained, showing Stephanie a text exchange between Talin and this friend of hers. Stephanie recoiled a little as the bright screen singed her eyes slightly. "A- what?" Stephanie sputtered, glancing between the phone and Talin. "A *race?*" She asked. "Yeah. I know you've got that old car in your garage." Talin said, "You've shown me before, haven't you?" she added. Stephanie bit her lip uncomfortably, and remembered that she *had* shown her the car. "Yeah..." Stephanie mumbled, "But I don't think it's a good idea for me to participate in a race." She sighed. "Probably an illegal one." Talin rolled her eyes and put her phone away, "I want to see that thing run." she said. "Besides, you need a break. Didn't you *love* driving, Steph?" Talin leaned back into the couch and crossed her arms. Stephanie sighed, and pulled her sunglasses back on. "I guess. Wouldn't hurt, maybe..." she mumbled, "The monster *has* just been sitting in the garage for a good couple of years." Under a tarp, the antique car hadn't been touched, and Stephanie assumed she'd never touch it again, especially after her mother berated her for taking it without her mother's permission. But now...perhaps now her mother's permission meant nothing. She didn't live there anymore, and the car *was* hers. Looking down at the floor and leaning forward, Stephanie clasped her hands together. "...It *is* my car." She muttered. "Mom can't stop me from taking my own stuff, can she?" Stephanie asked, looking at Talin. Talin nodded, "If you take the opportunity, there's a money prize aswell." Talin added to the list of 'should go' reasons, bumping Stephanie's shoulder with her fist. "We just gotta grab it first without...letting the bear get near us." Talin said. 'The bear' referred to Stephanie's mother, but Stephanie knew it wouldn't be a problem. "She can't stop us." Stephanie said, standing up. "I'm done letting her toy with me like I'm not a human being." \
"Good thinking!" Talin chirped, hopping up aswell. "Let's get outta here. I really wanna see that thing." She walked to the door, pulled it open, and marched out. "Hey- hang on-" Stephanie sputtered, following Talin out, and pulling the door shut behind her. "Hold your fucking horses!" Stephanie wheezed, catching up to Talin. "I don't even know where the damn race is." She kind of *needed* to know that if Talin wanted to watch her race. "Alright...alright, I'll plug it into my navigator when we get into the car." Talin muttered, shoving her hands into her pockets as the two walked down the dim beige hallway to the elevators, outside of Talin's apartment. Their footsteps were muffled by the red carpet underneath. Stepping into the elevators once it arrived, Stephanie hit the ground floor button, and the elevator shunted downwards, giving the two women a jolt. "*Hate* these things..." Talin muttered, rubbing her chin. "Hate stairs aswell, for that matter." She added quietly. Once the elevator arrived and they stepped out into the night, Stephanie realized they had a long walk to go. Looking around the dark street, Stephanie turned to Talin and asked, "When's the race start?" Talin stared at her and opened her mouth, "Well, uh..." she began, biting her lip as her eyes flicked around the street. "Y'see, uh..." What was she trying to say? Stephanie scrunched her eyes shut, pinched the bridge of her nose, and sighed. "*What* is it, Talin?" She asked, slightly annoyed. "...I *kinda* told the main guy there that your car'd be the main attraction...?" Talin said with a hint of fear in her voice. "Don't get mad...I know you haven't touched the car in a couple of years..." But Stephanie grumbled. "*Great.*" She sighed. "It's fine. It's fine." Stephanie let go of her nose and turned towards Talin. "I can probably drive it just fine. Don't like being the main attraction though." Stephanie explained, trying to keep her annoyance down. \
"Let's just go and get the damn thing." 

Half an hour later, Stephanie opened the garage door to her home, while Talin watched the second story lights to make sure her mother was still sleeping. Usually, her mother would go to bed quite early, leaving Stephanie and Maria alone. As the dark grey garage door rolled upwards while its gears churned, Stephanie couldn't help but feel a little nervous as she saw the tarp-covered car sitting in the dark garage, on a concrete floor. Finally, after a few dozen seconds, the garage door *thunked* into place out of everybody's way and Stephanie walked into the garage, running her hand along the wall to try and find the light switch. Flicking the light onwards, the old bulbs fizzled to life and flickered, revealing the large blue tarp over the car. "Still asleep." Talin called out, before walking into the garage. "Hoo, boy..." she said excitedly upon seeing the car, rubbing her hands together. "Pull it off. I gotta see it." Talin urged Stephanie. "*Hold* your fucking horses." Stephanie hissed, picking up the keys to car and shoving them into her jacket's pocket. Heading around to the front of the car, Stephanie latched onto the tarp and gave it a sharp *tug.* immediately, the tarp flew off the car and landed on the ground next to it, revealing the shiny black coat of paint that the car had. It was still shining. *"Wow."* Talin said, leaning forward and staring at the front of the car. The car was a Japanese sports car, manufactured between 1989 and 1993 by Nissan. "Nissan Skyline GT-R." Stephanie stated, crossing her arms. "BNR32." Unlike modern cars, the Skyline GT-R BNR32 was rather boxy, with a short and stubby spoiler at its rear, and the iconic set of four circular tail lights giving the car a distinct look. "My dad bought it for me." She said, looking at Talin. "Never could've got one myself. Do you know how hard it was for him to find one?" Talin was busy examining the car, "Must've been *hell.*" She whispered in response. "Fucking beaut..." Talin stood back up and crossed her arms. "Well...shall we?" She said, looking expectantly at Stephanie. "Passenger's around the other side, Talin." Stephanie said, walking over to Talin. "It's straight from Japan. Wheel's on the right-hand side, unlike every other car here." Stephanie explained, pulling open the right-hand side door to the driver's seat. Talin hurried around to the left-hand side and clambered in. Stephanie pulled herself in afterwards and slammed the door shut with a *thunk.* Pulling out the ignition key and sliding it into the ignition, she turned the switch, and the engine suddenly roared to life. \
Stephanie began to feel the rumble of the 312 horsepower engine through the car. "Mom's probably gonna hear this..." Stephanie muttered, sliding her hands onto the steering wheel and settling her feet on the gas and brake pedal. There was a third pedal for the clutch, set between the gas and brake. She didn't need it yet, but it would let her rev the engine. It would be nice just to hear the engine rumble like that again. Talin was watching the dashboard, eyeing the various meters and information displayed. "Okay." Stephanie said, inhaling deeply. Slowly, she pushed her foot down on the clutch and then the gas, letting the car rev. She couldn't help but smile as the engine roared again, the sounds bouncing off the walls of the garage. When Stephanie let off the gas, the engine made an odd noise, but one that was normal for the R32. A *whirr-hiss-flutter,* followed by the popping of the exhaust as it flamed slightly. Every time Stephanie revved the engine, the body of the car subtly shifted. Letting off of the gas and clutch, Stephanie shifted her left foot to the brake and pushed down on the gas with her right, rolling the car out of the garage. Settling her left hand on the manual stick shift sat in the middle of the car next to Stephanie, the R32 rolled down the driveway and Stephanie pulled the steering wheel to the right, bringing the heavy Japanese GT-R out onto the road. "Nobody's around." Talin said, holding onto the handle above the left-hand passenger side door, prepared for Stephanie to step on the gas. "Let the car stretch its wheels." She insisted, as Stephanie turned on the headlights, illuminating the dark road between the suburban homes. "Okay." Stephanie quietly responded, before slamming her foot down on the gas. The engine roared louder as the wheels spun, the ATTESA E-TS system letting Stephanie hold the gas down without needing to ease it in. \
Immediately, the speedometer and RPM meter began to rise, the needle for the RPM shooting towards the red part of the meter, indicating Stephanie needed to change gears. "Directions. Before I completely forget where we're supposed to be going." Stephanie said blankly, pushing down on the clutch and pulling the manual stick into the next gear. The engine emitted another *whirr-hiss-flutter* as the car began to speed up more, racing down the empty street. It may not have been as fast as a supercar, but it still felt like a lot, especially on a city street. Talin fumbled for her phone and pulled up her navigation app, and began guiding Stephanie to where the street race was, which was far outside the city near a large mountain with many, many twists and turns. Stephanie recognized where they were going, but was too focused on the road to talk. She slammed on the brakes and down-shifted around each corner, flying past any other vehicles still on the road in the area. The tires screeched and the engine rumbled around each corner, and as it speed up down straightaways, Stephanie shifted gears back upwards, the engine emitting yet another *whirr-hiss-flutter.* It felt good. It felt like Stephanie was back where she belonged.

Thirty minutes later, the Nissan Skyline GT-R pulled into an old parking lot at the top of Skeller Pass, the mountain that the race was supposed to be on. This parking lot sat next to an abandoned corner store, which had its many windows boarded up, and its doors were locked tight. However, there were a dozen cars of all sorts sitting in the parking lot, with people surrounding each and talking, but as the jet black 'Godzilla' GT-R pulled in, a few stopped to look. This car was the reason they were still sitting and waiting for the race to begin. Stopping the car and stepping out, Stephanie looked around at all the unfamiliar faces. She thought she'd look more out of place, but most people had crazy hair colours much like she did, but instead of pink and black...it was any colour on the rainbow. Talin stepped out of the car and approached a man leaning against the railing near the edge of the parking lot, bordering the road from the lot. "Oi." The man muttered, snuffing out a cigarette. He sounded British. He was rather thin and had no facial hair, and his short brown hair stuck up like spikes. "Glad to see you finally made it, eh?" He said, glancing at Talin. Stephanie followed behind Talin, and soon figured out that *this* was the man Talin was talking about. "That R32's gonna be the real star of the show tonight. Not every day you...you see one of 'em." He continued, looking at the Nissan sports car over Talin and Stephanie's shoulders. "You the driver?" The man asked, leaning his head towards Stephanie. She nodded. "Hmmm." He muttered, looking her up and down. "Yeah. Yeah, you'll do." He said, making a face that made Stephanie unsure of whether he was happy or not. \
"You'll be facin' off against one of 'em." The man began to explain, pointing a finger at the row of cars to his left. "They're all similar in class to ya, and, well...let's just say it'll be quite the fun night for whoever gets to face off against you." He said with a smile. "Speakin' of which," He pulled out his phone, "You'll be needin' the route. I'll send it to your phone, love." Stephanie's phone suddenly buzzed and when she pulled it out, she saw that she had gotten a message with the data for the route. "...Thanks?" She said, slightly perturbed, sliding her phone back into her pocket. "Now I gotta spin a wheel n' pick who'll be fighting you." He then walked past Stephanie and Talin and began addressing the whole group, explaining that the first race would soon begin. "I'll be with him." Talin said, approaching Stephanie. "He usually likes to follow the first race of the night down to the foot of the mountain in his own car." She explained, putting her hands on her hips. "What's he got?" Stephanie asked, and Talin pointed over to the far corner of the parking lot. There stood a new-gen Chevrolet Camaro, in light grey. "Huh. Simple." Stephanie noted, crossing her arms. "Yeah, but it's nice enough. He doesn't race with it, though. Unless you call following the first race racing." Talin replied, "But he's always behind. Never in front. You won't have to worry about him. His name's Vance, by the way..." Stephanie nodded, and spotted Vance coming back to them. "Alright. We're good to go. You're facin' off against a Reno Stinger." He explained, pointing behind him at a sleek modern sports car from a new manufacturer. "Similar horsepower, but it's rear wheel drive. Driver's a big fan of driftin'. You?" He asked. \
"No." Stephanie mumbled, shaking her head. She was always terrified of attempting a drift after she nearly crashed her car doing one. "So you'll be takin' advantage of the R32's downhill power. Smart, yeah." Vance nodded, crossing his arms. "Well, off you go. Get into your car, n' head up to the starting line. There'll be someone to count you down to go." He said, before waltzing away, towards his Camaro. Talin followed at a light jog. Sighing, Stephanie climbed into the R32, flicked the ignition, and rolled the car out onto the starting line where a man was standing patiently. The Stinger rolled up next to Stephanie, and she glanced at the driver inside. She couldn't see their face. *Okay,* she thought to herself, sliding her phone into a holder attached to her dashboard, before setting her hand on the manual stick shift. *Skeller Pass. Hope my muscle memory still knows what to do.* She knew the turns well, as this was where she put the R32 to the test originally. Downhill, sharp low-gear turns would help her win. And there were a large amount of those on this mountain, due to the way the road was constructed. Setting her eyes on the road, the man outside the cars raised his two hands with his fingers splayed, and began counting down from five. "Five!" He said, and Stephanie pushed her left foot down onto the clutch and pressed the gas down, revving the R32. "Four!" The Stinger revved its engine aswell, and both the cars' exhausts popped. "Three! Two! One!" He continued, before yelling... \
"GO! GO! *GO!*" The man flung his arms down to signal that *now* was the time to put the pedal to the metal.

<sup><sub>Cue RUNNING IN THE 90'S by MAX COVERI</sub></sup>

The all-wheel drive of the Nissan Skyline GT-R kicked in as Stephanie let off the clutch, slammed her foot down on the gas, letting the cars' thick road tires stick to the tarmac below. The Stinger's rear wheel drive slipped, its tires screeching against the road before taking off. The two immediately set off down the mountain, and Stephanie spotted the headlights of Vance's Camaro behind them. *Okay. Here we go.* She thought, using her left hand on the stick shift to advance the R32 into its second gear, and it began to pull forward, ahead of the Stinger. *This* was the advantage the ancient Japanese car had over the new manufacturer. A powerful low gear acceleration, but Stephanie knew what the car's downfall was: the understeer that occurred when a driver tries to force the car into a sharp turn. Unlike oversteer, it was easier for Stephanie to counter it, especially on a downhill route like Skeller pass. Around each corner, she would push down hard on the brakes, shift into a lower gear, and use the inertia to push the R32 into a steering angle it usually wouldn't be able to achieve on a flat road. As the R32 pulled further ahead of the Stinger, Stephanie felt her stomach twist as the downhill descent began, and the first corner rapidly approached. The lights lining the roads were flying by as the two cars sped up, their engines loudly roaring down the mountain. Stephanie pushed the gas pedal down harder, and carefully watched the RPM gauge rising. She would go into a higher gear than she wanted into the first corner and possibly cause the understeer to kick in. She had to stay on *this* gear, unless she wanted to crash into the first guardrails. In the right-hand wing mirror, she could see the Stinger trailing behind her, its lights glinting in the twilight. Further back, she could also see Vance's Camaro, its lights small pinpricks behind the Stinger. Flicking her eyes back towards the road, she finally saw the corner coming up. A sharp left turn, on a downhill incline. \
*Here goes.* She thought, and as soon as the car came close enough to the sharp curve, Stephanie slammed on the brakes, causing the axles to screech as the brake discs kicked in and forced the R32 to slow down. The ABS in the car let the wheels continue moving when the brakes were working, and Stephanie pulled on the stick shift to shift the car into a lower gear with a *thunk*. She continued to push her foot down on the brake as all the weight in the car shifted to the front, and she pulled the steering wheel to the left as hard as she could. The heavy Nissan was beginning to turn the sharp corner *just* as she needed it to. Her grip on the wheel was absolute, despite feeling the drivetrain's protest, which was making the leather wheel jostle slightly in as she held onto it with her right hand. Her heart was pounding. It was a rush she hadn't felt in *years.* The R32's engine roared louder, taunting the Stinger behind it, which had gone into a drift around the corner. Underneath her, Stephanie felt the grip of the tires against the road, as if they were completely glued to the road. The engine roared harder and harder as the Nissan rounded the corner, the exhaust popping distinctly.

![initial-d-r32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c05614a1-df08-4dc1-9f9d-e3ce2bff44db)

*Yes,* Stephanie thought. *Yes! This is it!* She smiled again, feeling the adrenaline pumping through her veins. The R32 pulled out of the corner and Stephanie immediately pulled on the stick shift to advance the car's gear back into second, and slammed the gas pedal to the floor, letting the acceleration take over as she straightened the wheel. Glancing at the Stinger through one of her rearview mirrors, she saw it getting further away. Its acceleration compared to the R32 seemed to be quite poor, but the driver's skills with drifting seemed to make up for that. It was a powerful car, no doubt, but on a straightaway with sharp corners such as Skeller Pass, Stephanie was certain the R32 could stay ahead. As long as the Stinger didn't attempt anything crazy, that is- or unless Stephanie herself tried something. *Thunking* the manual stick shift and fluttering on and off the clutch pedal with her free foot, the car moved into the next gear. The engine rumbled and emitted another *whirr-hiss-flutter* as the gear changed and the speedometer kept creeping upwards while the RPM gauge lowered. She saw the next corner rapidly approaching, a mirror of the previous one. Instead of left, it was right. \
Stephanie looked at her rearview mirrors again and saw that the Stinger was slowly gaining on her, its lights growing bigger as it got closer. *It's got speed.* She thought. *But it lacks acceleration and serious turning strength. I wonder what the horsepower of the engine is.* Vance had said it was a similar class to the R32, so it had to be somewhere between 300-400 horsepower. If it was 400 horsepower, however, Stephanie thought she'd be lagging behind, so maybe it wasn't *that* big of a gap. Slamming on the brakes and downshifting with a *thunk,* and another *whirr-hiss-flutter,* Stephanie pulled the steering wheel to the right and forced the R32 around the next corner. It was slightly steeper than the previous one, making Stephanie's stomach twist as the front bumper of the R32 got dangerously close to the inner guardrail. She couldn't pull out of this turn, unless she wanted to send the R32 careening into the *outer* guardrail instead. The loud engine echoed off of the mountain, down the road, and through the trees. The Stinger, as it too took the corner, was just as loud behind her. Stephanie felt her stomach twist again as she looking up into the rearview mirror only to see the Stinger *right* behind her. Had she slown down too much? Had she not use the car's acceleration to its maximum? The Stinger was drifting around the corner, keeping itself steady. Stephanie had taken the inside line into the corner, while the Stinger's driver remained behind her, not risking drifting on the outside line, so as to not be sent into the trees by crashing through the guardrail. Easing her foot onto the gas pedal as the road began to straighten out, Stephanie once again took hold of the manual stick shift and prepared herself for the next part of the road. Unlike the last two turns, the next one was gradual, winding slowly down the mountain before going into a second corner, an extremely sharp hairpin turn that Stephanie had always been nervous to go down at full speed, but if she was going to win, she'd have to take advantage of the corner. Pushing down on the gas pedal hard as the R32 came out of the corner, it began to pull ahead of the Stinger again. \
Following the soft, gradual turn of the long road ahead, Stephanie took the inside line just as she had with the two previous corners. This turn was to the left, so she was on the left side of the road. Right into oncoming traffic, yet there was no traffic to be seen...just a clear road. Stephanie saw the Stinger behind her go into a drift around the gradual turn, and she made a face. *What are they trying to do?* She thought. *That's only going to slow them down.* There was no reason to drift on this section. She had learned her lesson, as this wide, empty mountain road was where she had crashed her old car in a drift. Pulling on the stick shift and pushing the clutch pedal, Stephanie advanced the Nissan into its next gear, and the speedometer continued go upwards. And then again. As the winding road seemed to be getting sharper, Stephanie pulled the wheel to the left harder. It jostled slightly, and she felt the understeer push back against her. Glancing down the wheel, she felt her lip twitch and she pulled the wheel harder. It resisted even harder. *Not good. I need to slow down. But the Stinger...* She thought, glancing at the rearview mirrors. But she felt her stomach drop. The Stinger was gone. *Where did it-* She thought, but her mind's voice cut off as she looked to the side, seeing a second pair of headlights shining onto the road next to her. The sleek sports car was speeding alongside her as the corner got sharper and sharper. How had it gotten there? Her eyes went wide and she immediately turned to focus on the road again. The sharp hairpin corner was coming up. The earlier hairpin turns before it went downhill, but not as much as this one did, and not as sharply and suddenly as this one did. If the Stinger was going to overtake her, it would be there. Unless she could do something. Unless she could...but no. She couldn't. A bead of sweat ran down her forehead. There was nothing she could do other than get ahead of the Stinger by braking later than it and *drift.* If she took the inside line on the turn without drifting, she would for sure end up on the outside line coming *out* of the turn and the Stinger would easily get ahead of her on the downhill incline. 

But she couldn't risk crashing the car into the barrier. Could she? Stephanie would lose either way. To her, it was better to risk some damage to the car in an attempt to get ahead than fold, and allow the sports car past her. Pushing the gas pedal completely to the floor, Stephanie relented as the heavy Nissan Skyline pulled ahead of the Stinger again, and its lights flooded the road. The corner was ahead, and the downhill incline dropped further. *Okay.* She thought, feeling herself breathe harder. There was only one chance for her to do this, and it was now. As the corner began, Stephanie immediately pulled the wheel to the left and shifted her left hand from the stick shift to the handbrake behind it. Pulling the handbrake as hard as she could, she immediately felt the rear wheels of the R32 lock up and the rear of the car began to skid to the right. *Oh, shit. Oh shit- oh shit, oh shit.* Her mind exploded with panic as she began to attempt to counter the weight by pulling the wheel to the right. Her heart pounded harder as both of her hands scrambled to keep the wheel steady. It was trying to fly all over the place, and she *had* to keep it to the right as long as the car was in the corner. The wheels began to screech against the road, sending tire smoke billowing behind it. The Stinger followed, going into a drift just as Stephanie had done. Stephanie's foot fluttered on the gas pedal as she tried to keep control of the Nissan Skyline while it screeched around the corner. *Oh my God. Ohmygod. Ohmygod.* Her mind echoed as despite her fighting back against the R32, the rear wheels began to skid more than they should. "No-" She hissed, trying to keep the steering wheel under control while it began to jostle to the left and back to the right rapidly. "Stop- *stop-*" Stephanie begged the car as the wheels skid even further. Just as suddenly as the drift began, it ended as the rear slid too far out and crashed into the outer guardrail, letting the Stinger speed past the R32. As the bumper slammed against the guardrail, the force of the hit sent the car careening away, the rear of it once more whipping around, but in the opposing direction, now facing the inside line. The front of the car turned towards the outer guardrail, its headlights shining into the forest past the railings. Tire smoke billowed from all four tires as the car skidded across the road, before it slid to a stop in the middle of the road. Stephanie was jostled in her car seat, the seatbelt holding her in. She was hyperventilating and her knuckles were bone white as her hands held onto the wheel tightly. As the Stinger vanished down the road, its red tail lights disappearing around the next corner, Vance's Camaro rounded the corner and screeched to a stop, letting Talin get out and run over to the driver's side of the Nissan Skyline GT-R BNR32. Stephanie, her eyes glued to the hood of the R32, reached out and rolled the window down. Sweat was running down her forehead. She watched her peripheral vision as Vance also got out of his car and approached the window. Stephanie's mind was blank. She had lost. Despite her lead, she was now sitting in a stationary R32, blocking the road. \
"Steph?" Talin said, her voice slightly muffled as a high-pitched buzzing filled Stephanie's ears. "Steph...?!" She repeated, jabbing her shoulder. Stephanie blinked and remembered where she was, and inhaled sharply. "...Huh?" She sputtered, looking at Talin. "Are- are you okay? You lost..." Talin said, sounding disappointed. "Not a bad thing." Vance replied to Talin, leaning against the roof of the car. "I saw what you were doin'." He began, adjusting his glasses. "Ya tried somethin' out of desperation, and it- it didn't work." He sighed. "It happens. Shame it was here, too. Only 'bout halfway down." Vance pat Talin on the shoulders and walked back over to his Camaro, climbing back into the driver's seat. Stephanie let go of the wheel and leaned back, finally feeling her muscles relax. They had been tense the entire time. "It happened again..." Stephanie breathed, shutting her eyes. "It just wasn't as bad as last time. I'm lucky there were railings..." Talin watched Stephanie, frowning. Her heart was still pounding, and despite Stephanie slowing down her breathing, it wouldn't slow. "Well..." Talin stuttered, "well, I thought you did good. You were ahead of the other car up until right at this turn, where you messed up." Talin looked behind her at the straightaway the Stinger had disappeared down. "I heard from Vance that this turn, in particular, is where a lot of skilled drivers meet their downfall, just because they can't drift around it. It's hell, so..." She looked back at Stephanie, "I don't think you should feel bad. You just let the car slip."

An hour later, Stephanie had sent the Nissan Skyline GT-R to an acquaintance who was going to repair the minimal damage to the car. Two of the rear headlights had popped and shattered when the car hit the barrier. There was also some damage to the bumper. Until she could get the car back, Stephanie felt defeated. There was no reason to go back to racing, especially since she knew she would never get around that corner without losing. Lying on Talin's couch, deflated and tired, Stephanie scrunched her eyes shut. There was nothing she could do except go straight back into the investigation. If Cisila was going to abandon it, then it became Stephanie's responsibility. She couldn't give it up, now that she knew too much. Perhaps Han would help her where Cisila couldn't- or wouldn't. 

Now that she thought about it...where *was* Cisila?

#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 26

*One of Cisila's darkest moments. Desperate to find where the mysterious figure (Lyla?) is, she hunts down groups of the Syndicates, whom she's begun to believe are behind this whole scheme. After all, Lyla was roped into Cisila's life by the Syndicate, was she not? The Haze continues to dilute her memory, poisoning it. As she takes more and more hits, the further she gets down the darker path, the more violent she gets. When nobody can tell her who the mysterious figure is, she kills the gang members blindly. The purple hue of the Haze gets more and more intense as the rain falls harder, puddles form in the dark alleyways of Chicago, as she loses herself. She has nobody left, not right now. This entire section is supposed to be long, gruelling, and a showcase of what happens when a combination of bad things happens to a good person. But just as she drives her blade through the last Syndicate member in her most recent fight...she spots someone down the end of the alleyway. The rain falls even harder.*

*The mysterious figure she's been trying to find desperately. And she already knows who it is. Lyla. Lyla reveals herself, and slowly holds up a gun towards Cisila. The Haze kicks in again, seeing the dread in Cisila's mind. Everything fades out as Cisila swiftly knocks the gun out of Lyla's hand and bashes her away. Lyla immediately engages Cisila in a fight, yelling at her. But Cisila can't hear her. Cisila can't see what Lyla really feels. Once more, she is blinded by the Haze. Cue A STRANGER I REMAIN for the second fight against Lyla in the entire storyline.* \
*Cisila, despite trying to resist, kills Lyla. Chapter ends as the Haze fades away, and Cisila looks at the blood on her hands.* \
*What did she just do?* \
*But then suddenly, Lyla comes out of the remaining fog of the Haze, and Cisila's vision goes pitch black.*


The barrel of her revolver was pressed against the forehead of a Syndicate member, who was trembling. His eyes were locked onto Cisila and his hands were raised to his shoulders. "Look, I don't-" He sputtered, but Cisila just took a step forward, pushing the Syndicate member back with her revolver. The two were standing in a dark alleyway as sheets of rain poured down on Chicago, puddles lining the streets and drenching those who were still outside. "Come on, I- I don't know...what you're talking about...!" The Syndicate member sputtered again. Cisila stared blankly at the main, the Voice in her head whispering. *He knows. He must know. They all know. It's all their fault.* It hissed to her. The Haze clouded her vision, and everything had a slight tint of purple. Cisila couldn't see the fear in the man's face. All she could feel was anger. Annoyance. Every negative emotion had fired up at the same time, and had turned her senses to mush. "*Where* is she?" Cisila hissed. "Where's who?! I- I- I dunno!?" The man stuttered. Cisila pushed him further down the alleyway with the barrel of her revolver, her boots immersed in a small puddle from the rain. The man stumbled backwards, splashing through a puddle behind him. "Come on...come on, just lemme go...I don't have a clue...!" The man begged. *If he doesn't know, someone else will.* The Voice hissed. *But now he knows your face. He's going to warn his friends.* That wasn't allowed. He wouldn't leave this alleyway. "Come on..." The man repeated, his voice breaking. Cisila slowly set her finger against the trigger of her revolver, pressing the barrel into the man's forehead. "No, no, *no,* come on...please...!" The man stuttered. "Shut it." Cisila hissed, pulling the trigger. *Click.* With a deafening sound like an exploding firecracker, the revolver went off, and for a brief moment, the alleyway was filled with the light from its muzzle flash as the recoil forced her wrist upwards. The .44 caliber bullet went straight through the man's head and came out of the other side. Cisila didn't even get a proper look at his face the entire time. And now he fell to the ground, dead. Twirling the revolver around before sliding it back into its holster, Cisila stepped over the man's body and walked towards the other end of the alleyway, which led back out onto another street. Her boots splashed through the large puddles that were steadily rising from the heavy rain. The wet streets reflected the neon signs hanging from every building, making the roads look like a canvas of bright pink, purple, cyan and every other colour imaginable. The sky was pitch black, the vast dark clouds blocking out the night. How many other Syndicate members would be roaming the streets tonight? How many of them would know? *All of them. All of them must know. It's their fault, is it not?* The Voice whispered. It was right. This was the Syndicate's fault, Lyla's disappearance. It didn't even matter which Syndicate it was, but Cisila knew in her heart that it was *them* and that they would *pay.* They were the hooded figures she had seen. They were trying to delude her into thinking it wasn't them. But she *knew.* Ignoring the few pedestrians around her as she stepped out onto the sidewalk, Cisila immediately stepped onto the road and walked across it. This particular street was pretty much empty, and the only cars on the street were parked along the sidewalk. Thunder rumbled as she reached the other end of the sidewalk and made her way down it, peering into any alleyways that Syndicate members may have been using for weapon or drug deals. Most were empty. Most were useless. As she continued to walk, any people still walking along the sidewalk at this time stared at her. She must have looked like a mess...her hair was messier than usual, and there were dark eyebags under her eyes. She had stopped taking care of herself like she usually did, all because she was too focused on what mattered. Finding Lyla. No longer did she care about whatever the "investigation" was about, since the Stephanie girl would handle it. Suddenly, her eyes locked onto a group of what looked like Syndicate members enter a building. She saw their metal pins glint under the light of the buildings, and they matched the dress code for the Dragons. Picking up her pace, she looked up at the building they had entered. It seemed to be an old apartment complex, without any tenants actually in it. This side of Chicago was mostly empty, old, and rotting. Whatever this group of Syndicate people were planning to do, she would crash straight through it and get the answers she needed. Pulling both of her revolvers out of their holsters, she walked up the steps to the building just as the doors slid shut behind the Syndicate members. Bashing her shoulder against the door and breaking the handles open, Cisila stepped inside. The Syndicate members turned on their heels to see a shadowy figure silhouetted against the backdrop of the street outside. "...What the *fuck?!*" One of the members, a woman, hissed. Without another word, Cisila flung her revolvers up and pulled their triggers at the same time. It didn't matter if either of her shots landed, she just needed to send the group into a panic. Each revolver fired, a deafening *BANG* following the trigger pulls, and the bullets flew straight past the group, and ricocheted off the walls. The group immediately sprang into action, two sprinting up the stairs and another going into the basement. The last, the woman who had spoken, pulled out her own pistol. "Oh no, you fucking *don't,* you weasel..." The woman hissed. Under the dim lights of the old apartment building, Cisila caught a glimpse of the woman's face. She seemed younger than Cisila, and her hair was tied back into a low ponytail. She wore a red leather jacket, jeans, and thin glasses. Holding onto her pistol with both hands, the woman aimed a shot at Cisila, who lunged forward. "NO!" The woman screamed, pulling the trigger. *BANG.* The sound echoed off of the walls.

Cisila, low enough to the ground to avoid the gunshot, flipped the revolver in her right hand around so she was holding onto the barrel and sprang up at the woman, swinging the pistol around so the woman was pistol-whipped in the face. Grunting, the woman stumbled. But Cisila didn't let up. She pistol-whipped the woman again, sending her careening into the wall. That was enough for now. The real troublemakers would be the ones who went up to the next floor...and if she didn't find them now, they would sneak up on her. Flipping her revolver back around so she was holding it proper, Cisila made her way up to the next floor. The moth-eaten carpet was sturdy under her feet, and the dim lights caught the peeling wallpaper along the stairs, making long shadows from particularly peeled parts of the wall. Finding her way up to the next floor, Cisila pointed her revolvers down each end of the hallway, her head flicking from one end to the other. She strained her ears, trying to hear any footsteps. Breathing. *Anything.* Something thunked down the left side of the hallway, and she only had a second to react. One of the apartment doors burst open and the first of the two Syndicate members pulled out their own firearm and tried to unload it into Cisila. But she was faster. She was stronger. She was *better* than these sacks of meat. One trigger pull. Two. Three. Four. *Five* deafening bangs from her revolver. Every shot she hadn't made yet was fired straight into the man, who dropped his pistol. Blood seeped through his white-collar shirt. Each bullet had pierced his chest and stomach. One had clearly punctured a lung and possibly gotten to his heart. The man stumbled back, putting a hand against the wall next to him. Cisila approached him and swiftly kicked him to the ground, using her second revolver to shoot him in the head. The sound of the shot echoed off of the walls. *Piece of shit.* The Voice echoed. Cisila heard footsteps behind her, and immediately whipped around, unloading her second revolver into the second Syndicate member, who was rushing down the stairs from the second floor. *Smart. But not smart enough.* The Syndicate member tumbled down the stairs and slammed into the floor, and ceased moving. Now there was only the one in the basement left, and, if she didn't talk, the woman aswell. Making her way back down the stairs, she found her way into the apartment's basement, walking past the woman who was slumped against the wall of the entrance. Walking down the cold concrete steps, she quietly holstered her revolvers and snuck into the basement. Spotting the last Syndicate member hiding behind a shelf of boxes, Cisila tried to find a way to her without getting spotted. She quickly found a way through to the shelf hidden by piles and piles of boxes that had probably not been touched in years. The woman was hiding in a shelf near the middle of the room, and Cisila made a clockwise half circle path to her. She was as quiet as could be...and suddenly, she was behind the woman. In a flash, she had grabbed hold of the woman and shoved her against the concrete wall. "What the-" The woman grunted, trying to reach for her pistol. Cisila pulled it out of its holster and threw it away, sending it clattering to the floor. Using her Construct to pin the woman to the wall around her neck with a metal brace, Cisila let go of her temporarily, and reloaded both of her revolvers in front of the woman. She struggled, her hands gripping the metal brace around her neck, trying to pull it off. "Fuck!" The woman grunted, pushing away from the wall. But the brace had melded with the wall and was impossible to get off, until Cisila de-Constructed it. Putting a revolver to the woman's forehead, Cisila asked the same question that the man in the alleyway couldn't answer. "*Where* is Lyla Silvermann?" She hissed. "...What?!" The woman grunted, continuing to struggle. "*Where is Lyla Silvermann?*" Cisila repeated. "Who the *hell* are you talking about?!" The woman hissed back. "I don't fucking *know.* Why the hell would I-" Cisila flipped the revolver around and pistol-whipped the woman in the face. Her head snapped to the side. De-Constructing the brace, the woman fell to the floor. "I asked you a question." Cisila said quietly. "It's a simple 'yes' or 'no', sweetheart." The woman looked up at Cisila, her lip bleeding from the pistol-whip. "I see how it is." The woman grumbled, her dark hair beginning to cover her eyes. It was messier than Cisila's. "I'm not giving you a fucking thing." She hissed. "Not a yes. Not a no. I don't give a damn."

Holstering her revolvers, Cisila dragged the woman into the middle of the room. "Then I'll just have to *beat* an answer out of you." Cisila responded, stretching her hands before cracking her knuckles. *If she doesn't have an answer...she dies. And if the other one doesn't, she dies, too.* The Voice insisted. "I don't *have* an ans-" The woman started, but Cisila punched her in the jaw. There was a *crack* and the woman winced. Then, she followed up with another punch, snapping the woman's head to the side. "Fuck...!" she sputtered. "If you're going to refuse to answer, at least tell me your name." Cisila said quietly, sliding a hand under the woman's chin. *Toy with her.* The Voice hissed. *Toy with her.* "It's...Amelia." The woman responded. "Amelia..." Cisila repeated. She let go of Amelia's chin, and the woman stumbled back. "That's too bad." Cisila hissed, punching Amelia in the jaw again. Wincing again, Amelia fell to the floor. But Cisila picked her back up. She punched Amelia again. And again. And again. It felt like an eternity. No words were traded. Cisila just kept punching Amelia, pulling her back up, and punching her again. Eventually, Amelia hit the floor again, and Cisila finally repeated her question. "*Where* is Lyla Silvermann?" She hissed. "I don't...*know*..." Amelia winced. Cisila pulled one of her revolvers out from its holster and shot Amelia in the stomach. Amelia made a horrible noise in response, and began bleeding from her stomach, through the white-collar shirt. Just like the man on the second floor. "Fuck...!" Amelia wheezed, trying to pull herself away. "What is your prob-" Cisila stomped down on her hand, immediately breaking it. Without letting Amelia breathe, Cisila followed up with a heavy kick to the side of Amelia's head, sending her sliding across the concrete floor. "Stop it- stop...!" Amelia breathed, trying to pull herself up. Cisila pulled her second revolver out and unloaded both of them into Amelia, with a cacophony of deafening shots that bounced off the walls. A pool of blood began to seep from Amelia's body, and she screamed. "I know you know." Cisila whispered. She slid her revolvers back into their holsters, and loomed over the bleeding Amelia. She was now bruised, and the cut in her lip was bleeding harder. "You've got one final chance to tell me." Cisila cocked her head to the side expectantly. She was going to talk, or she was going to die. Coughing up blood, Amelia winced. "I don't- I don't *know-*" She whispered weakly. "Why are you even after us...?!" Amelia asked quietly. "Because it's all *your* fault. All of you." Cisila hissed. Her hand automatically went to the Haze inhaler sitting in her pocket, and she drew it out, put it to her lips, and inhaled. Her vision pulsed, and double for a moment, becoming ever more purple. She slid the inhaler back into her pocket, and stared down at Amelia. She could see clearly now. This *piece of shit* knew nothing. There was no reason for her to live. *There is no reason for any of them to live.* The Voice added. *Kill her. Kill her in a way that makes her feel as much pain as possible.* Slowly, Cisila raised her foot and pressed it down onto Amelia's head. Her boot rested on the side of her head, her heel pressing down on Amelia's temple and the tip of her boot sat on her cheek. "Wait...wait, what are you..." Amelia breathed, but Cisila began to crush Amelia's head beneath her foot. Amelia winced painfully, and began to struggle with what energy she had left. Putting more and more of her weight into her head, Cisila looked up at the ceiling. Amelia screamed. Her skull began to split apart under Cisila's foot. Her jaw broke. Amelia's screaming ceased suddenly, and she was dead. Without any remorse, without even a second thought, Cisila stepped over the poor woman's body and went back upstairs.

On her way out of the building, Cisila pulled out her revolver and finally shot the first Syndicate member she'd fought in the head, who was still slumped against the wall. She didn't even get a word in before she was dead. Sliding the revolver back into its leather holster, Cisila left the apartment building and walked back out into the rainy night. If these grunts didn't know anything, then she knew for sure who would. *Dan* would tell her whether or not he wanted to.

#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23

*After losing during the downhill road battle, Stephanie returns to the investigation. Cisila has stopped answering her calls, having found Lyla- though this is unknown to Stephanie, but known to us through the previous chapter. She worries about Cisila briefly, learning that the Haze comes from the Syndicates, but quickly turns her thoughts back over to the investigation and goes over what she has. Each victim was connected to the LHD-0404 project in one way or another. All Equinox employees were murdered for possibly being against LHD-0404, while the Carbine Industries victims' reasons for murder remain unknown. She thinks of how to obtain any information on Carbine Industries, before suddenly remembering...Maria, her sister, works for Carbine. Calling Maria, she explains what's happened. Maria quickly rushes out of her workplace, explaining afterwards that people were listening. Before Maria begins though, she apologizes for what happened with their mother. She explains that she didn't want to be the one to tell Stephanie to stay away, but had no choice in the matter. After Stephanie left that night, her mother took out the remaining anger she had on Maria. Stephanie assures her it's fine, and urges her to explain the Carbine situation. The two victims were higher-ups working on a weapons project, pre-emptively named Haze. Stephanie notes the identical name to the inhaler, and continues to listen. It sounds like a new weapons system focused on quietly dispatching assailants and/or turning them away via illusions, warping vision, and mental shutdowns. Stephanie slides down her chair the more she listens. The more she hears, the more it sounds exactly like the Drug. It becomes a lot clearer all of a sudden: Equinox Medical must have been supplying the drug for the weapons systems.*

*Maria quickly ends the call with a remark that she's been spotted. Stephanie immediately begins to worry, and similar to how Cisila broke into the Equinox Medical building, she heads for the Carbine Industries Chicago outlet, in her R32. Rolling into the parking lot, Stephanie is almost immediately surrounded by what look like Syndicate members, climbing out of white vans as Maria suddenly bursts through the doors of the Carbine Industries building, and immediately recognizes the R32. Sprinting to the car, she leaps in and screams at Stephanie that they need to run. Recognizing that the Syndicate is the Dragons, Stephanie immediately takes reaction. Cue RUNNING IN THE 90'S by Max Coveri for the first car chase/fight scene hybrid in the whole story. This is going to be long, focused on the integrity and understeer of the R32 under pressure while being chased (this will likely make up majority of the chapter and could make this one specifically be incredibly long).* \
*Escaping the Syndicates, Stephanie parks the R32 once they get out of Chicago at a park swathed in darkness. Stephanie and Maria sit down, and discuss what just happened. Maria knows that, despite her best efforts, someone still heard her. Carbine has been tightfisted in allowing people to talk about the weapons systems and LHD-0404, and Maria personally believes that the two companies, Carbine and Equinox Medical, are trying incredibly hard to keep the project from surfacing. It's the most plausible reason as to why Carbine and Equinox employees have been murdered. Maria seems unfazed.*

*Getting back in the car, Stephanie drives Maria back to Equinox Medical after she thinks it's safe. Arriving there, for some reason...Stephanie fades out. She goes unconscious.*

*Cisila wakes up in a chamber, tied to a chair. Surrounding her are cloaked figures, just like Lyla. But they aren't Lyla. She killed Lyla.* \
*But then, as her vision corrects itself, she spots Lyla also tied to a chair. She looks fine, uninjured- despite what just happened. The two stare at each other, confused. But one of the cloaked figures cuts the two free, and the circle of spectators draws back as they watch the two stand up. Looking around even more confused, Cisila runs up to Lyla. The two quickly see what happened. Cisila feels a deep pang of fear as she realized that the Haze lied to her again. It feels alive in her pocket...but she can't let it go. She can't let Lyla know, either. For the time being, all they can do is get out. Whatever the group was trying to do, it clearly doesn't work as Cisila and Lyla go back-to-back, raising their fists. Were they expecting them to fight? Who knows. But their connection is too deep. The Cloaked Cult pull out their weapons, and engage the two. Cue PHYSICAL by Dua Lipa, the only goddamned pop song in the whole saga (For now. Wait until later.) as Lyla and Cisila fight back the figures and escape.*

*Once out, Lyla confronts Cisila about Haze. She's well aware Cisila has it, and explains where it comes from. Given what we learn from Stephanie's perspective, a few details Lyla says are no surprise. The Dragons pedal Haze, and use merchants to sell it (like Talin). And just like Stephanie learned in the previous chapter, Cisila learns from Lyla that Haze is the name of a weapons system Carbine is designing, with bioweapon help from Equinox Medical. She looks down at the Haze inhaler, and puts two and two together. LHD-0404 is Haze. She stares into the Haze logo hastily scribbled on the inhaler, and feels terrified. The voice in her head, the Haze, has been what she was looking for the whole time. She throws it down and crushes it beneath her foot. The inhaler cracks, and the remaining Haze fluid leaks out. She needs to warn Stephanie that, somehow, she is a part of the problem. Trying to contact Stephanie, she finds nothing. No response. But Talin knows when Cisila calls her, and says that she is already taking care of it. Cisila can't help but rush afterwards anyways. But as she leaves, she slows down...and more...and more...*

*A serious withdrawal from Haze. It completely takes her out of the moment, and makes her yearn for the Haze again. But she can't. She forces herself to leave, but she's going to go somewhere else. The Lighthouse...*

*In an identical situation to what just happened to Cisila (perhaps on purpose?) Stephanie is captured by the murderer, and brought to Equinox Medical. There, she learns something she didn't know previously. Stephanie has been tied to a chair by the murderer, whose identity is 'revealed'. An androgynous person who is only known as the Crow, after their mask- a plague doctor's mask. The murderer calmly explains what's going to happen to Stephanie. She is going to be killed, and so is Cisila. They cannot escape their fate, and even if Stephanie gets out of this, she will be found by the Crow and killed just like the rest of the LHD-0404 project team who went against it. The murderer seems cold and emotionless.* \
*Unluckily for the Crow, Talin finds Stephanie. The two break out, backed by DELUSIVE BUNKER by LUDOWIC from Katana ZERO. On the way out, Stephanie acquires a police baton, and finds it fun to use. She keeps it and decides to see if she can figure out how to use it better.*

*Talin and Stephanie make it out of the Equinox Medical building, only to discover that it was a bunker. Rushing back up onto the street through a manhole, Stephanie and Talin climb into the Nissan R32, and make an escape. On the way out, Cisila calls them, and tells them to go to a Lighthouse just outside the city, and gives directions. Almost as soon as they leave, they see that they're tailed. Two sleek, modern sports cars from the Syndicate. Two things have to happen in order for them to be able to get to the lighthouse: they need the route. And they need to lose the cars. And to do that, Stephanie makes a turn towards the area outside of the city, a road she knows that is extremely winding. The sports cars easily catch up to the R32, but once they reach the top of the mountain - a place exclusive to this universe - and the downhill drive begins, Stephanie overtakes them. Cue THE TOP by KEN BLAST for a battle for street superiority. Inspired directly by Initial D First Stage's TAKESHI NAKAZATO v. TAKUMI FUJIWARA fight, this exemplifies the control and power Stephanie has over the R32. "The R badge on the back...can you even get close enough to see it?!". Despite the superior hardware of the Syndicate cars and cons of the R32, Stephanie begins to lose them as the drivers lose control of their cars, smashing into the road barriers or crashing straight through them. "Now they've fallen, I'm at the top! Are you ready now to die?"*

*Arriving at the Lighthouse for the first time, Stephanie and Talin finally meet Lyla, and Kasey, who has returned from Japan. The group, including Cisila, decides to slow down. Lyla, who immediately takes a liking to Stephanie, sits her down and tries to make sure she's okay. Cisila joins, and holds out the Haze inhaler. It's cracked. Stephanie slowly takes it, looking at Cisila. "I feel like I'm suffering from a really, *really* bad withdrawal." She explains, and that is why she wasn't able to show up during the escape from the bunker. "I need a few days to recover. I'm sorry." She says regretfully. Stephanie nods, and puts the Haze into her jacket, for later. During Stephanie and Lyla's conversation, Talin can be seen watching them with a slightly mournful look on her face. Is it jealousy? Or is it something else? Cisila seems to be happy watching the two talk, and soon, the two head up to the top of the lighthouse when Stephanie feels like opening up to Lyla. Here, we learn the entirety of Stephanie's backstory.* \
*Her amazing father. Her terrible mother. Her sister. A flurry of odd emotions run through Stephanie as she recounts her life to Lyla. "I always hated mom." Stephanie admits. "But I didn't know why, until she rejected me." She sighs. We find out that her R32 was a gift from her father, who knew she desperately wanted one. He worked incredibly hard to find and buy one. Unfortunately, he is no longer alive - his cause of death was sickness. After Stephanie is done, Lyla begins to explain how uncomfortable she is with what happened with Cisila. Stephanie nods, understanding...she saw it firsthand. The crowd in La Lune Brillante...* \
*They both know that it was the Haze, but the horror of Cisila doing these things sticks with them. "I know it wasn't her, but..." Lyla tries to explain, "She nearly killed me. She never attacks first. Not when she has control over herself."*

*Down below, Cisila tries to talk to Talin, but we see that she's rather closed off, as opposed to when she's with Stephanie. Cisila relents, gets up, and heads over to Kasey. The two chat about what Kasey was up to in Japan, and Kasey is apprehensive to explain. When she learns what happened in Chicago, she's disappointed in Cisila, but pushes forward nonetheless, knowing that despite Cisila's own apprehension, the case has progressed smoothly, with the help of Stephanie, Talin, and Han Daehyun, whom we haven't seen for a majority of the chapters. She's also glad to know that the Haze inhaler was destroyed during the encounter with the cult.*

*The group get back together at the Lighthouse at an odd time, and discuss what they've found throughout their separate investigations. This is a chapter to lay out the foundation of the mystery of LHD-0404, putting it together clearly. The cult, who Lyla informs the group seems to be using Haze. Carbine, who is using Haze for its new bioweapon systems. And Equinox Medical, who made Haze, or LHD-0404. The murderer, or the Crow, who seems to have been hired by the project leader of LHD-0404 to kill any and all people against the project. Who or why this is happening remains unknown, and the group begin to brainstorm who the project leader is, but they get nowhere. Instead of trying to figure it out on their own, Stephanie calls Maria, but when she picks up, Stephanie is met by the Crow instead. They state that they have Maria. They then tell Stephanie to go outside...Talin is watching Stephanie, nervously.*

*Stephanie and the group step outside, only for the Crow to emerge from the darkness around the Lighthouse, and pulls out a gun. They shoot Cisila, Lyla and Kasey before anybody can do anything. Putting the gun away and staring at Stephanie and Talin, the Crow backs away and enters a car, driving away. When Stephanie wonders out loud how they were found...Talin quietly says "It was me. I'm sorry."* \
*Stephanie turns to Talin, shocked. Talin, regretfully, pulls out her own pistol, and points it at Stephanie. "They told me I'd have to kill you, them, and then myself." But before Talin can do anything, Cisila wrenches the gun out of Talin's hands and throws it into the ocean. Talin punches Cisila in the face with surprising strength, before turning towards Stephanie. Cue I BELIEVE IN YOU from YAKUZA 5 for an unexpected fight against Talin. When the fight ends, Talin collapses, and tells Stephanie one thing.*

*"It's Maria..." She mumbles, despondent. "You need to snap her out of it."* \
*And then, with that, Stephanie pulls out her phone only to see a news notification. "LHD-0404 'HAZE' PROJECT TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY"* \
*Stephanie looks to Cisila, who immediately says they need to find Maria. But Stephanie points out the car that the Crow stole...it was Lyla's. Turning to Lyla, they find out they can track the car. The best thing they can do is chase after them. Stop them before something else happens. And now is the only time.*

*Getting into the R32, Stephanie and Cisila take off after the Crow, who seems to be heading for the mountain, or Skeller Pass as we find its name out. But as they get to the top, Stephanie spots cars behind them in the rearview mirrors. Syndicate cars. Just before the craziness begins, she reflects on what's just happened. Talin was forcefully turned against them by Maria, and the Crow just shot Lyla, Kasey, and Cisila. They might be patched up now, but that's not all the Crow has done. Under Maria's command, the murderer has killed a dozen people to keep a project's true intentions below ground. And just now, Equinox Medical seems to be planning a ruse. A fake interview or something to cover up LHD-0404, Haze, as something much better. But they're living on borrowed time as Cisila and Stephanie go after the Crow, and then...unfortunately, Maria.*

*Cue BACK ON THE ROCKS as Stephanie puts the pedal to the metal to get away from the Syndicate cars. The first turn of the reverse way of Skeller Pass is too flat for Stephanie to decelerate and use a low-gear turn to get through. Her grip on the wheel tightens as she folds under the pressure, latches onto the stickshift, and pushes the Skyline R32 into a drift, around the corner. The entire time, her mind is blank. She's terrified.*

*But back on the road, and now going properly downhill, she's able to regain control of herself. Letting the Nissan Skyline GT-R BNR32 'Godzilla' roar, Stephanie lets herself focus, as Cisila watches nervously. This entire chase is going to be incredibly long (probably most of the chapter!), and only 'ends' once the R32 exits Skeller Pass and gets back onto the Chicago highway. We shift to Cisila's perspective as they draw closer to the Crow's (well, Lyla's...but still) car, and she hangs out the passenger window, pulling out her revolvers. Her goal: stop the car on the highway. By force. Cue BATTLE OF PRIDE from YAKUZA 5 for a Yakuza-like car section.*

*Chapter ends as the cars get off the highway and onto a main Chicago street, where the Crow's car crashes from Cisila's relentless gunfire, going into an off-kilter drift before flipping onto its side.*

*"It's getting away."* Cisila hissed, holding onto the roof handle on the passenger's side of the R32 with one hand, and her phone in the other. "I *know.*" Stephanie replied, pushing her foot down on the gas as the R32 rolled out onto the deserted road. Its headlights shone down on the road, paving the way. "If we don't get to it before it gets on the highway, we'll lose it." Stephanie muttered, watching the speedometer meter rise. The R32 began to pick up speed, the engine roaring louder and louder. There were no street lights on this road, as it was far outside the city. Chicago, the neon cityscape in the distance, seemed to taunt the two as the Nissan Skyline GT-R followed the fastest route towards the Crow, inside Lyla's own car. "What is it *doing?*" Cisila muttered, staring at her phone. "It's taking Skeller Pass...why?" She asked, to nobody in particular. Stephanie glanced over at Cisila, her brow furrowing. "...What do you mean it's taking *Skeller Pass?*" Stephanie replied. "There's no reason for it go there. There's another route that leads to the highway faster." There was just one question, other than *why* the Crow was taking that route. Do they follow it up the mountain? Or do they take the longer path around it...Stephanie pushed the gas pedal further down and advanced the R32 into second gear with a *thunk* from the stick shift, the engine emitting its unique *whirr-hiss-flutter* as the gear changed. The midnight black R32 sped up, its tires spinning hard. "Do you think you can head up Skeller Pass?" Cisila asked, looking at Stephanie. Her tone was doubtful, Cisila was unsure of whether Stephanie could follow the car up the mountain she had previously crashed in. "I can try." Stephanie replied, pulling the steering wheel to the left and onto the entrance to the Pass. "But this way around...there's a lot more corners that you'd usually drift around. It's either..." She paused, watching the road ahead and the trees on either side of the road whip by. "It's either drift, or slow down to the point that going there would be pointless." Cisila watched the road ahead aswell, frowning. "We need to stay as close to that fucker as possible. If you can do it." She said. The road began to get steeper as the mountain truly began. "Up we go..." Stephanie muttered, pulling the car around the first corner. It was useless to speed through the steep roads, Stephanie knew. The real problem would begin on the decline, on the other side of the mountain. "I've never been up here before..." Cisila suddenly brought up, looking out at the road. "It's always been pretty close to the lighthouse. And I've always heard cars...like yours, no doubt." She looked at Stephanie, who glanced at Cisila and smiled a little. Flicking her eyes back to the road, Stephanie suddenly saw something from her rearview mirrors. "...What the..." She whispered, staring harder. Her eyes went a little wide as she realized what she was seeing...*headlights.* "Cisila..." She sputtered, turning the R32 around another corner. As they got higher and higher, and closer to the highest point of the mountain, Stephanie began to get more and more nervous, and as a result, the car was speeding up. "What is it?" Cisila asked. Stephanie looked at the wing mirror on the driver's side. There were half a dozen other cars behind her. "...Cars. It's the Syndicate." She hissed. \
*"What?!"* Cisila replied, her tone completely changing. "Is this because of what you did at La Lune?" She asked. Stephanie's brow furrowed again, and her lips tightened. If the Dragons had found her, and wanted revenge, she refused to give it to them. The R32 rounded the final corner and the road finally flattened out for a brief moment. "It must be." Stephanie said, advancing the R32 into its next gear, the stick shift clunking into place. "They don't know when to give up, huh..." she muttered, watching the bright white lights of the vehicles behind her inch closer. "As long as they stay far enough away, we don't have to do anything to them." Cisila said, craning her head to look out the rear of the R32. "Can you do that?" She asked, looking at Stephanie. Stephanie's grip on the wheel tightened. "I can." She replied. If the drivers behind them were any good, Stephanie knew they would be some trouble. But for whatever reason...Stephanie suspected the drivers had no idea what they were getting into. Their orders, whatever they were, attracted them to the R32 and Stephanie like moths to light. And no matter what, they would follow. But how far they were able to follow before they crashed, Stephanie wasn't sure. "I'll show them what happens when you mess with the GT-R." She muttered, flattening the gas pedal to the floor. The R32 let out a roar as the engine kicked up in power, the wheels spun harder, and Stephanie set her eyes on the road. "They nicknamed this car *Godzilla...*" Stephanie continued, "Do you think any of them know that?" She glanced at Cisila, thunking the stick shift, and the *whirr-hiss-flutter* from the engine kicked in again. Stephanie stared harder at the upcoming road...but just as she did, something flashed through her head. Voices of doubt. The voice of the one person who hated her to her very soul. *"You're a disappointment."* Her mother's voice echoed. *"You'll never amount to anything. You can't dig yourself out of the shithole you're in. You're a failure in every sense of the word."* Stephanie knew that she was wrong. Her mother had always been wrong, from the moment she had turned against Stephanie. Even if she wasn't here to see it, Stephanie would prove her mother wrong. Her heartrate sped up as her grip on the wheel tightened, and she took a deep breath. "I wonder..." She muttered, reaching up to push her sunglasses further up the bridge of her nose.

*"...Can they face off against the Godzilla, and come out alive?!"* She hissed.

The descent began. The trees flew by faster and faster, the guardrails on either side of the wide road a blur, along with the lonely street lights. The midnight black Nissan Skyline GT-R E-BNR32 would show *why* it was called Godzilla, allowing Stephanie to finally break free of her confines. On this road, *she* was the queen, here and now. The heavy vehicle accelerated faster and faster, the turbo charger kicking in as the road dipped downwards into a long straightaway, towards the first, sharp corner. "Jesus...!" Cisila sputtered, holding onto the handle tighter. She wasn't used to going *this* fast in a car. The speedometer continued to creep upwards as the car roared closer and closer to the corner. Just like she had done so many times before, Stephanie would employ her normal technique on this corner...it was the next few turns that would cause her problems. But right now, right here, she had only one concern. Get the *hell* away from the Syndicate. Glancing at her rearview mirrors, Stephanie saw the cars drawing ever closer, their lights growing larger and larger, resembling the light of multiple suns behind her. *First turn.* Her mind hissed. *Go, go, go!* She stamped on the brakes and pulled the stick shift twice, downshifting the car two gears. The axles screeched and the brake discs turned a bright, glowing hot orange as the calipers pushed in on them. The ABS, once again, kept the wheels rolling as Stephanie pulled the steering wheel to the right, around the first corner. The bumper of the car drew scarily close to the inner guardrail as Stephanie turned the wheel further and further, the two front wheels turning harder and harder. The weight of the car's load dampened the understeer, letting Stephanie pull the car well and truly around the corner. She continued to keep her foot on the brake pedal as the corner opened up, and as soon as she straightened the wheel out, Stephanie lifted her left foot off the brake, slammed her right foot down on the gas, and shifted the gear one last time upon exiting the corner to allow for maximum acceleration. Cisila and Stephanie were pushed back into their seats as the Nissan Skyline rocketed forward. "It's- getting further down the mountain." Cisila reported, wincing. Before Stephanie could reply, she heard the distinct, loud screeching of tires and crumpling of metal. One of the Syndicate cars had already crashed, on the first turn. The rest had made it around the turn just fine, but it seemed like the lead car, whatever it was, had understeered horribly or mis-timed a drift, and had crashed through the guardrails. But the rest continued forward, their drivers pushing the cars as hard as they could to keep up. One separated from the pack and inched closer and closer, its bright white lights growing closer and closer, shining onto the rear of the Skyline. Stephanie pulled the wheel to the left to accomodate for the soft, gradual turn the road was going into. It was an identical route to the one she had faced the Stinger on, but that was on the other side of the mountain. This had been the route she had taken up to that area from Chicago. Instead of various turns she could complete with the R32's all-wheel-drive, this side of the mountain was going to force her to drift. But despite her fear, her newfound experience driving her beloved Nissan again made her believe she could do it. A lot depended on it, too. If they could get to the Crow, they would finally catch the murderer who had caused all of this to happen. And then they would find Maria, and destroy the LHD-0404 before it could go public as a "welfare project", despite its real use. Stephanie just had to get down this mountain. She *just* had to drift. 

As the Syndicate car drew closer, Stephanie pulled the R32 to the far left of the road, letting her have the inside line on the next corner, where she knew she had to drift. The car pulled out to the right, having been blocked by Stephanie. "Jesus- Jesus, *fuck-*" Cisila once again sputtered, her grip on the roof handle tight. The corner, a sharp hairpin turn, was coming up fast. This was it. If Stephanie crashed, everything fell apart. But if she succeeded...well, she'd have to do it several more times. But if she could do it once, she could do it again. "I wonder what this person thinks they're doing." Stephanie hissed, getting herself ready for a proper drift. Unlike last time against the Stinger, she wasn't going to pull the handbrake. She was going to lift off the gas, slam it down again, and flutter her left foot rapidly against the clutch to disconnect and reconnect to mess with the grip the rear tires had on the ground, and use the downhill weight to push the R32 into a left turning drift. Suddenly, the R32's headlights revealed the corner, and just as suddenly as it appeared, Stephanie pulled the wheel to the left, downshifted through the gears, lifted off the gas and slammed her foot down on the metal pedal so it hit the floor. She slammed down the clutch, lifted off, and began fluttering her foot on it. The R32 began to slip, the rear sliding out towards the outer guardrail. "Shit-...!" Cisila hissed, scrunching her eyes shut. Stephanie's feet were both working to keep the car from oversteering, as were her hands. She was holding onto the steering wheel with both hands, her left hand temporarily off of the stick shift. The wheel, just like it had against the Stinger, was vying for control against Stephanie, jostling every which way it could, trying to break free of Stephanie's grip, which was keeping it to the left. Unlike the road battle against the Stinger, however, Stephanie remained in control. The car careened around the corner, tire smoke billowing up and temporarily blinding the Syndicate driver behind them. Stephanie's heart was racing as the R32 whipped around the corner and stayed steady. The corner, just as suddenly as it appeared, straightened out, and Stephanie yanked the wheel back around so the two front wheels were once again parallel to the car. "Holy shit holyshit-" She sputtered, feeling beads of sweat run down her face. "Holy *fucking shit!*" Cisila blurted, her wine coloured eyes wide. "You fucking *did it!*" Holy *hell,* Stephanie *had* done it. She pushed her foot down hard on the gas once more, rocketing the R32 forward. The Syndicate driver, whatever they had done, was falling behind. "I'm *shaking."* Stephanie stuttered, feeling herself quivering to her very bones. Another deafening crash came from behind them as another car failed to get around the corner, but instead of just careening away from the barriers, it seemed to have crashed through. Cisila whipped her head around to look, and just *barely* caught a glimpse of the shattered outer guardrail. "That one's gone..." She muttered, turning back to look ahead.

The two police officers stood over the body of a woman who was lying on the floor in a pool of her own blood in the dark basement. "Jesus Christ..." The first muttered, shining a flashlight over the body. "It's like her head got crushed like a goddamn watermelon." He added, looking at his partner. "Ain't...ain't nice to look at." His partner said, pulling out her own flashlight and looking around the room. "Nothin' as to who did it, either. Positioning of the body might be suggestin' it was a foot that crushed her skull." She mumbled her way through her thoughts. The first officer crouched next to the body and looked closer. He *did* see what looked like the footprint of a boot in the blood trickling down the woman's face. "Might be something there." He muttered, shining his flashlight over the face, before wretching slightly. The woman's left eye had popped out of its socket. "Urgh..." He grunted, pulling himself up. The female officer sighed, "Gonna have to call an ambulance or somethin'...we can't leave these bodies sittin' here." she muttered. "Yeah. I'll put in a request." The male said, walking to the stairs back up to the lobby of the building. "You sit here and make sure it doesn't move. Can't have evidence disappearing on us." He added, looking back. "You got it." The female officer said, nodding. She leaned against the wall, and turned off her flashlight. "Hate this place, though. Be quick, will ya?" She snapped at the male. "Yeah, yeah..." The man said, as he began walking up the stairs. The woman pulled out an e-cigarette and began puffing it, quietly breathing. The basement was cold and damp, and the sight of the corpse didn't help her feelings. The other three bodies in the building had more obvious signs of a fight from positioning and gunshot wounds. This corpse had gunshot wounds aswell, but it looked more like the victim had been beaten brutally before having her head crushed beneath a boot. *Who would do this?* The woman thought, staring down at the corpse. *What would possess someone to kill like this?* She wondered. She nearly jumped from surprise when she heard her partner call from above, "They're coming- mind heading up? I can't...stomach moving these myself!" He yelled down the stairs. "Jesus fuckin' Christ..." The woman muttered, shoving the e-cigarette back into her uniform. "Quit bein' a baby." She hissed up at the man as she walked up the stairs, leaving the body alone. They had tried to identify the woman twice, but failed. The skull was too mangled and neither of them had wanted to move the body for fear of getting their fingerprints all over what evidence there might have been. The rain that had previously been pouring down only a couple of hours ago had dissipated, leaving the full moon shining down on the city. The moonlight made its way through the window in the basement, shining just after the corpse of the woman. Brutally beaten, Amelia had been killed by Cisila only a couple of hours ago. Her body lay there, twisted and glistening with blood, her hand broken, and half of her skull shattered. Her white collared shirt was stained with deep, red seeping blood. Suddenly, out of the silence in the basement, something skittered across the dry, cold concrete floor. Its metal limbs clattered along the ground. It looked like a metal spider, but had no abdomen. It seemed to be just legs. Many legs. It randomly zig-zagged along the floor, trying to find its goal. Its metal glinted as it passed through the moonlight, revealing that it seemed to be extremely scuffed and dirty. A core of deep purple-red was in the middle of its eight spindly limbs, pulsing slightly. It clitter-clattered along the floor some more, discovering the footsteps of the police officers. Despite having no fangs to click, it made chattering, clicking noises, as if trying to indicate something. As if to say it knew it had a limited amount of time before it was discovered by the two police officers. Skittering its way over to the body of Amelia, it chattered again, its clicking noises mixed with some vaguely vocal noises, distorted beyong recognition. It was impossible to tell what it was trying to convey as it began to crawl its way onto Amelia's body. Puncturing the shirt with each step it took with its sharp metal limbs, it slowly and carefully crawled its way towards Amelia's crushed head.

As it carefully took its first steps onto the head, it clicked and chattered once more. Suddenly, it emitted what sounded like an order. It bounced off the walls of the basement, and despite it being intelligible, it was still distorted beyond belief. *"Wake up."* It said. *"You cannot go to sleep yet."* It insisted. The metal spider finally covered the hideous injury completely, and began to burrow itself into the concave area where her skull had shattered. Its limbs punctured her skin, and it dug itself into her face, slowly disappearing beneath the smooth skin. It seemed to take an eternity, but it disappeared just as the female officer walked back down the steps to the basement. "Okay..." She muttered, walking towards Amelia's corpse. She turned on her radio, "Last corpse comin' up." She relayed, before pulling on a pair of gloves. But before she reached the corpse, she stopped. Frozen, the female officer stared in horror. Had she seen that correctly? She stared harder at the hand of the corpse, only for her heart to skip a beat. The hand *twitched.* "What-" The officer sputtered, taking a step back. She blinked, trying to figure out what happened. That *couldn't* mean anything, right? Surely the nervous system was just- she paused. She flinched again as she saw the hand move more. The fingers snapped back into place, with a horrible *crunch* for each. The hand was *repairing* itself, and slowly, the rest of the body flinched aswell. The legs moved first, twitching. "What- *what-*" The woman sputtered, fumbling for her radio. Turning it on, she was about to call on her partner for help, but she wasn't even able to get a word out when she was overcome by complete and utter horror. The body, in a flash, had disappeared. All that was left was the thick pool of blood that it had rested in only mere moments ago. And then she looked down, suddenly realizing she was unable to feel her hand. "...*What?*" The woman whispered weakly as she looked down and noticed that her hand was *gone.* No, not just her hand. Her arm. *Her entire arm was gone?* Where? How? Why? It was then she suddenly felt the pain in her shoulder. It was overwhelming. "What..." She repeated, barely able to talk. Horrified, she craned her head to look at her shoulder. Her entire arm had been *ripped off.* It was *gone.* All that was left was blood, which trickled down her side. Her eyes went wide as she spotted a silhouette behind her. Slowly and weakly turning towards the woman that had previously been lying on the ground, dead. The silhouette loomed over her and the officer had only one question to ask. *"Why?"* She whispered. But she never got a response. Instead, she felt a searing pain in her abdomen as the figure lunged forward and stabbed something extremely sharp through her body. The officer coughed up blood and winced, unable to get another sound out. Unable to call for help, the officer tried to pull out her pistol and shoot the figure. But, just like her left arm, the figure tore her right arm off with a horrible *rip.* Her expression went blank. Her eyes glazed over. *"Oh...you weren't who I thought you were."* The silhouette whispered, dropping the officer's arm. *"That's a shame."* She added, kicking the officer down to the ground. Stepping into the moonlight, Amelia looked at her hands. Sharp, rigid and scuffed metal wound its way around her arms, all the way to the tips of her fingers, where it disappeared back into her body through the tips of each fingers. It was like a second skeleton over her hands, her arms, and as she realized, her upper chest aswell. The metal punctured straight through her collarbone and supported her neck aswell. Reaching a hand up to her neck, she felt cold metal separating pieces of her skin. She noticed that her outfit, a plain white-collared shirt and black dress pants and sleek matching dress shoes, were deeply stained with her blood. Still wet blood also ran down the side of her face that had been crushed by that woman...but now it didn't matter. Now, she was breathing again. And the reason for that was...Amelia slowly reached up to her face, feeling the area where that woman had crushed her skull in. She felt pieces of thin metal under her skin, and some on the outside. *"Fuck..."* She whispered, lifting her head towards the ceiling. She slowly opened her mouth, letting her jaw stretch for a moment, before she rolled her head slowly. It felt *good* to be alive again. Death had been unpleasant. Death had been unwelcoming. Being pulled out from that abyss, by whatever had saved her...it felt like God saving her. *"What are you?"* She whispered, running her hand down the now uncrushed side of her face. *Undeath.* A voice in her head echoed. *"Undeath..."* She repeated. *"Thank you."*

There was a long pause as Amelia savoured her life. She flexed her fingers, rolled her wrists, and lifted her head towards the ceiling once more, closing her eyes. She breathed deeply, and slowly. *"What do I do now?"* She quietly asked. The voice didn't respond, but she instead felt a strong pulse in her brain. It was telling her to *run.* The police were here. The police...that was this woman, she realized, as she looked down at the officer's corpse. *"There's only one way out of this place..."* She recalled, looking around. *"I can't avoid the police. What do I do?"* Amelia asked the Undeath. Again, it refused to respond. Instead, she felt a sudden searing and puncturing pain through her forearms. "What- what the-..." She winced, as suddenly, her arms began to feel steadier. Stronger. "...Your solution is *that*." She muttered, flicking some hair out of her eyes. "Alright." She relented. "If you insist." And with that, she began to slowly walk up the stairs to the lobby. Each step felt agonizing. She had never been in a proper fight before, and she knew she was still injured. Whatever the Undeath was...it hadn't fixed her completely. It had only softened the pain and fixed her skull. There wasn't much she could do if she was shot, she suspected. Or maybe, just perhaps, the feeling in her arms that the Undeath had given her was a misled attempt to help. Amelia couldn't really fight. Slowly surfacing in the lobby, Amelia looked around. It was as dim as it had been when she had entered with her friends only a few hours ago. The wallpaper was peeling, the floors were slowly coming apart. The only problem...she could see a group of police officers talking in the middle of the lobby. The ones whose faces she could see froze as they noticed Amelia surface. "What- what the fuck?!" One of them said. The man who had been with the woman. "WHAT THE FUCK?!" He screamed, flinging an arm out at Amelia, pointing at her. Immediately, the group turned around and pulled out their pistols, aiming them at Amelia. Each one had a small laser pointer under the barrel, and each of the officers were aiming directly at her. She felt pain in her lungs suddenly, and breathing worsened significantly. "Put your hands where we can see them!" The man ordered, training his gun on Amelia's forehead. "You're...you- *how?!*" He stuttered. Amelia's vision was starting to get blurry. "What the..." She mumbled, grabbing the side of her head. A splitting headache had slowly made its way through her head. "Ow- *ow...*" She grunted. The officers paused, seeing her grasp her head. "Uh...is she alright?" Another one said. "SHE'S A WALKING CORPSE!" The man yelled, "She- hang- hang on- where's Merryl?" He suddenly realized. "She was just down there..." The man slowly connected the dots and his rage seemed to flare up. "Go find Merryl!" He hissed at one of the other officers. The one he hissed at sprinted straight past Amelia and made his way down the steps to the basement. Amelia's headache was getting worse. It was beginning to feel like her brain and skull were going to split apart in two. She grabbed hold of her head with both hands and stumbled. "Fuck...what- what is...going on...?!" She hissed, breathing heavily. Sweat was beginning to roll down her face, diluting the blood on her face. Her ears were starting to buzz, a high-pitched noise filling them. Her vision was starting to fill with what looked like thick static as her mind seemed to go into overload. Her grip on her head tightened, her fingers dug into her skin, piercing it slightly. "Fuck- fuck-" She winced, before the pain in her head exploded. It burst through her entire body, searing hot. She couldn't help but scream, and the officers aiming their guns at her flinched, one talking a step back. "No- No I don't fucking like this..." The cop said, but even in her immense pain, Amelia heard something off. It was like, as he spoke, the man's voice was slowing down. And then suddenly, the pain died down. *"What?" She said, slowly letting go of her head and looking up. Her breathing slowed down, but her vision was still full of static. Her arms were full of pins and needles, and she noticed...everything had stopped moving. Everything had been doused in a purple-red hue. 

Time had slowed to a crawl. Slowly, Amelia stepped forward. Still, the officers remained frozen in place, the lasers no longer pointed at Amelia, but past her shoulders. She picked up her pace and shoved her way past them, her walk turning into a light jog as she went down the stairs of the entrance. Police cars sat at the curb, accompanied by an ambulance. Amelia didn't have time to check, but she knew her friends were in there. Instead, she made her way past the police cars and sprinted across the road until she found an alleyway to hide in. As time suddenly resumed, she tripped, and slammed into the pavement in the dark, damp alleyway. Amelia slowly pulled herself up and felt the pain in her lungs again. The splitting headache was slowly returning. But in the midst of that, an urge from the Undeath pulsed again. *Find someone to fix you.* It insisted. 

And that she was going to do.
