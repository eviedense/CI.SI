#### endless fight - Yakuza 5 - SEGA SOUND TEAM

Her entire body had gone numb. She had lost all feeling. Around her, the bright lights flashed and the crowd around her cheered and leered, as she fell back against the high-tension ropes around the ring. Her back pressing into it, Stephanie weakly raised her hand to her lip and wiped blood from it. She was struggling to stand. Her opponent at the other end of the ring cracked their neck from side to side, still full of energy. Stephanie herself was covered in bruises and cuts, and her gloves were starting to fall apart. Her tanktop was drenched in sweat, that of which also rolled down her forehead as she pulled herself back up slowly, limping. The fighting ring was flooded in blue, purple and pink lights. Surrounding it, there were sets of bleachers raised above it so the onlookers could see every detail of the fight. As she stood back up properly, shaking her head, Stephanie's hair caught the light. Her bright hot pink hair, the black roots of her hair, and her thin face. Her hair was a mess, and it barely reached her shoulders, where it wrapped around her neck. She had ear piercings and eyeshadow on, but because of the intense situation it was in, the eyeshadow was starting to mix with her sweat and disappear slowly. Stephanie blinked slowly, scrunching her eyes shut before opening them wide. Her opponent was waiting for her to get back into the zone, and she obliged, slowly raising her fists again. Her bare arms were bandaged up from previous injuries, and it looked like she had been fighting all night. Stephanie, by this point, was on her last legs. But this next opponent couldn't stop her, surely. As they stepped towards her, Stephanie went in for a jab at their stomach, but they grabbed onto her arm and bashed her away. Stumbling backwards, Stephanie shook her head and, instead of going in for another punch, whipped around and raised her leg up, kicking her opponent in the face. A powerful *crunch* came from the opponent's face as her foot made contact, and their head whipped to the right. Using her brief opportunity, she went in for a three-step combo. A jab to the stomach, and then an uppercut into the jaw, followed up by a kick to the stomach, sending her opponent skidding away. Grunting, they let out a yell and rushed at Stephanie. *FUCK!* Her mind screamed, and she barely ducked out of the way, instead letting her opponent smash right into the high-tension ropes, which bounced them back. Thinking she had a moment to attack, Stephanie went in for a heavy punch to her opponent's face, but she got caught first as the opponent knocked her arm out of the way and bashed her in the face. Spitting blood out of her mouth, Stephanie returned the punch as hard as she could. It didn't do much, and the two started trading blows. Each hit made Stephanie feel even more numb than before. And it kept getting worse. She stopped feeling everything. Her opponent's fist went straight into her cheek and she felt her arms drop to her sides. 

The crowd's cheering got even louder, before it started to fade away. Everything went fuzzy around her. Stephanie didn't even feel it when she hit the floor, because she had already gone unconscious.

It felt like only a brief moment before she felt someone prodding her cheek. Stephanie felt herself wake back up, and she slowly opened her eyes. *"Ugh...*" She mumbled, raising her head a little to look up at who was above her. Making a 'tch' sound, she let her drop back down, dejected. It was just Maria, her sister. She had been there to watch Stephanie fight again. "Hey..." Stephanie heard Maria say, through her buzzing ears. "Hey. Steph." Maria repeated. She grunted a response and refused to move, shutting her eyes again. It was only now she felt her entire body in pain. Stephanie let out a deep sigh and finally spoke properly. "Maria..." She mumbled, "Can you...not?" \
Stephanie slowly opened her eyes once more and looked up at Maria, and finally noticed that she wasn't lying in the ring. "Not what?" Maria said, pulling Stephanie up from the bench she was lying on, and sitting next to her. They were in one of the back rooms of the fighting club, and the lights were a bright, painful white, which reflected off of the metal sinks bolted to the walls. Stephanie had no idea who actually *used* those sinks, but there were a lot of them in the back rooms. She frowned and looked at Maria, "I mean..." Stephanie muttered, "quit *following* me here. I don't know what you're trying to do." She wiped her lip again, before Maria handed her a towel. Taking it, she dried her face. "You always end up like that." Maria stated, "Mom always gets worried. Tries to call you, only for you to end up in the hospital in the morning without a word." She pushed her black hair out of her eyes and sighed, adjusting her sunglasses- which, for some reason, she was wearing indoors. But Stephanie tended to do that aswell, so she couldn't judge. Maria was wearing her black jacket aswell as her favourite pair of worn blue jeans. Stephanie was dressed in her fighting ring getup: Her grey tanktop, and a pair of black cargo pants, and a worn pair of runners. "I don't care what Mom thinks." Steph said, lowering the towel. "She doesn't even like me." She sighed, "so why does she care so fucking much about my safety?" \
Maria stared at her for a moment, blinking behind her sunglasses. "Uh- er..." She mumbled, "I dunno." Stephanie rolled her eyes and slowly got up. She slowly limped over to the lockers on the other side of the room, and pulled her own one opening after fumbling with the lock. Slowly, she changed into her usual outfit. A jacket made with a mix of cotton, fabric and leather. The leather was almost like an accent, while the cotton and fabric made up the main part of the jacket. It was quite soft, but firm. Like her hair, the jacket's colours were hot pink and black. It was an equal amount of pink and black, so as to not overdo the colours. She'd had it made for her personally, and as she pulled it on, she slowly buttoned it up. The collar was rather large, and she flipped it up. She changed her cargo pants into a pair of pristine black jeans, and swapped out her runners with hiking boots, coloured grey. "Just go back home, Maria..." Stephanie said, rubbing her eyes. "I'll be back soon." \
Maria took a moment to respond, as she was looking down at her hands. "Huh?" She sputtered, looking up. "S-sorry, yeah...yeah, I'll go. Yeah." Maria mumbled, getting up slowly and heading towards the exit of the back room. Before she pulled open the door, Maria looked back at Stephanie, who was just sliding her sunglasses over her eyes. They were frameless, thin, and had side shields with a sleek and compact weave design, which completely hid her eyes from view. "Steph..." Maria said, adjusting her own glasses. Stephanie didn't respond, and instead pulled her satchel over her shoulder. "Steph." Maria repeated. "...Huh?" Stephanie muttered, looking up at Maria. "Steph- you..." Maria bit her lip uncomfortably, and she fumbled with the door handle, trying to find the right words to say. "Mom doesn't..." she paused again, letting out a deep breath. Maria looked nervous. "Mom doesn't...want you home today." She finally said, after a couple seconds of awkward silence. \
"W- what?" Stephanie asked, raising an eyebrow. "Why not?" Maria silently stared at her for a moment, before shaking her head. "She didn't tell me why. She just...she just told me..." she mumbled, trailing off. Stephanie felt her emotions fade away for a moment, as she was left confused. "What- I..." She stuttered, "I don't-...why?" Stephanie asked again, her eyes wide behind her sunglasses. Maria ignored her, and instead pulled the door open, and stepped out. She left Stephanie standing in the empty backroom, staring at the door. 

There wasn't much Stephanie felt anymore, but it was like a switch had flipped in her head. She knew exactly why her mother didn't want her home. And that meant she'd finally made up her mind. Sighing deeply, Stephanie turned away from the main exit and headed towards the other door on the opposite end of the room. Opening it with a key and stepping through into the main club, she fought to keep her tears back. *Deep breaths.* She thought. *Deep. Breaths.* \
Her mother no longer considered her her family. And that also meant she was no longer a girl to her mother, either. Stephanie knew that her mother wouldn't want to be near her after she'd finally come out, but she just couldn't understand why her mother still thought she was a boy. It had been years of work, and she felt confident in herself. She pushed her thoughts away as she made her way along the empty club floor. The entire club was a conglomerate of all sorts, she remembered, trying to take her mind off of things. The fighting ring she'd fight in was only a side part to the main nightclub, which had a bar attached. It was called *La Lune Brillante*, or *The Bright Moon* in English. It was where she spent most of her time. Walking across the empty club floor, she looked upwards at the DJ booth and the second floor. Stephanie had never been up there...maybe, next time she came, she'd check it out. Not like she'd have much better to do...shaking her head, she walked over to the entrance and pushed the two old doors open, stepping out into the abandoned subway tunnel that the club had been built in. There was graffiti and makeshift lights set up to make the tunnel more welcoming, but it still gave Stephanie the creeps. The subway tunnel had been closed for decades, ever since 2003. She knew it was related to a horrible accident one of the subway trains had found itself in, and one of the exits was blocked completely, a building collapsed over it. The local city council had elected to completely rebuild the subway system's underground tunnels, while favouring the L Train system to keep traffic under control. Heading down the tunnel, Stephanie found a ladder to climb up that she knew ended up in an empty street that nobody went to. She gripped onto the ladder, and began to pull herself upwards. Each step she took up the ladder made an echoing *clang,* bouncing off the tunnel walls. After a brief climb, Stephanie pushed the manhole cover out of the way and pulled herself up onto an empty street, where the only lights were street lights, that of which flickered on and off. Their bulbs had been replaced by the club staff, so instead of a warm orange, the street lights shone purple down on the street. Pulling her phone out of her jacket's pocket, Stephanie looked at her messages, of which she had a few. Her friends were wondering where she was again...and why she hadn't shown up to their party. Uninterested in responding, and too overwhelmed to do anything more, Stephanie put her phone away and headed down an alleyway between two buildings. She could probably sneak back into her room in her mother's house and lock the door, but that would likely only work for one night. And there was *still* the walk home. As she walked through the alleyway, the darkness seemed to swallow her briefly, no lights near enough to send any light into the alleyway. She continued to walk, and walk along the alleyway. When, suddenly...

Something meaty crunched underneath her foot. A bone snapped. "What th-" Stephanie sputtered, stumbling back. She quickly pulled out her phone and turned on its flashlight, and nearly screamed. A man was slumped against the wall, filled with bullet and knife wounds. *A murder...* \
It took her a moment to notice, but when did, she almost threw up. There was a large hole torn out from his chest, where his heart was. *Was.* She thought. *It...doesn't look like it's there anymore.* She kneeled down next to the man slowly and tried to see if he had any belongings still on him. Stephanie wasn't one to help too often, but it felt warranted that she at least tried to find out who the man was. Nobody else had found him, including the police, which meant that she would be a sole witness. But what she didn't consider as she stood up, was that she could be a suspect aswell. Something she missed was that being found next to a body was very damning.

And as she turned away from the body, she noticed a figure step into the alleyway. Stephanie froze, her phone flashlight pointed at the ground. It looked like another woman. And she seemed to notice Stephanie, who was still frozen. The woman slowly reached their arm into their harness, and pulled out a bulky, silver revolver. Stephanie couldn't see their face, but she could see the colour of their clothes. Purple. Slowly, the woman approached Stephanie, holding the revolver up, aiming it at Stephanie's forehead. "Don't move." The mystery woman said, her boots thumping along the ground. "Hands up, aswell." She added. Stephanie did as she was told, and raised her hands, her flashlight pointing up into the sky. The mystery woman pulled out her own flashlight, and shone it at Stephanie. She flinched, despite having aviators on. And that was when she finally got a look at the woman's face. A plume of brown hair covered the right side (Stephanie's left) of the girl's face, and a pair of sharp scars tore their way up her jaw to her cheek. Her only visible eye was coloured like wine. And she couldn't help but think...she was *really* pretty... \
"Please tell me you're not the one who just did that." The girl said, indicating the corpse. "Uh-" Stephanie sputtered, reeling herself back into the moment. "No. I didn't. I don't have a gun. Or- or a weapon, of any kind." She said. The woman took a step closer, and Stephanie flinched again. "I swear!" She sputtered, "My name's Stephanie! Stephanie Layton! I'm 23!" The woman smiled, "Yeah, yeah. Alright. Well..." She cocked her head to the side, "You haven't shot me yet. Could you...at least empty out your pockets? And that satchel?" She asked. Stephanie nodded slowly, and did as she was told. She opened up her satchel and went through every bit of space in there, showing the woman. And then she emptied her pockets. "...Okay. Thanks." The woman said, lowering the revolver. She twirled it around and slid it back into its holster on her harness. "Sorry about that. I'm Cisila Siveta. A detective."

There was only one thing rattling around in Stephanie's mind now.

*She's so pretty. And her voice is so beautiful.* \
Stephanie had to shake her head to pull herself back into the conversation, but she was ready to tell this detective whatever she needed.

Walking into Siveta's office, Stephanie slowly sat down on a squishy couch, which sat in front of Siveta's desk. Siveta herself sat down and leaned back in her chair, stretching. She grumbled, before leaning forward, and placing her face into her hands. "Okay..." She muttered through her hands. "So, you found that body there. Like that. And you stepped on the guy's hand?" Stephanie nodded, before remembering Cisila wasn't looking at her. "Er- yes." She said. "Right...okay," Cisila mumbled, pulling her face out of her hands. She pulled the man's ID out of her pocket and held it up. "It was just...some guy." She said. "But his heart was missing." She examined the ID carefully, turning it over. "I was hired to follow a case, and it seems like this guy was the next victim. The killing is always identical, with a person's heart ripped out. But there's something different about it." Stephanie pulled her sunglasses off and raised an eyebrow. "How?" She asked. "There were no bullet wounds or knife wounds on the previous killings." Cisila said. She bit her lip in confusion and put the card down, "Oh, by the way..." she said, looking at Stephanie. "What were you doing out there?" She asked. Stephanie's eyes went a little wide, "Uh...I was just heading home. G-Got caught there by you." She felt extremely nervous every time she spoke. "Alright." Cisila sighed, and she pulled out a notebook, picking up a pen. She began to note stuff down. "Can you give me your phone number?" Cisila said, looking at Stephanie over the notebook. "Uh...why?!" Stephanie sputtered. Cisila's brow furrowed and she looked a little annoyed. Sighing, she began to explain. "Each person who's found one of the victims - which is what I've always gone off of - have disappeared shortly thereafter." She said. "No bodies. I don't know if they died or not. If it's okay with you, I'd like to keep in contact, just to make sure you don't disappear." *I'm sure Mom would love for that to happen.* Stephanie thought, frowning. But the prospect of having this really pretty girl continue to talk to her was too good to pass up. "Yes- yes. Uh- of course." Stephanie stuttered, nodding. "Okay." Cisila frowned, putting her notebook down. She picked up her phone, and her brow furrowed more as she looked at it. Her expression briefly switched from her firm blankness to sadness, before she pulled the facade back up. Putting her phone down, Cisila looked back at Stephanie. "Are you...gonna leave?" She asked, eyeing Stephanie. "Um- yeah. Yeah. I'll go." Stephanie said, getting up. She shook her wrists out and walked towards the door. The office was drowning in a warm orange light, and most of the furniture looked old. It didn't look like Cisila was the one who had put everything up...or at least, Stephanie guessed so, from what little she knew about the pretty lady. *Ugh. Quit it.* She thought, trying to push her thoughts out of her head. But she couldn't, and as she got to the door, she looked back, and couldn't help herself. "Hey- um-" Stephanie blurted, "You're really pretty!" \
Cisila stared at her with confusion etched into her face. Her mouth was open a little. She blinked, and didn't say anything. Stephanie just stayed there, frozen. "You're...you're not too bad yourself." Cisila said, looking down at her desk. She looked sad. Stephanie decided to try and probe her. "...Something up?" Stephanie asked. Cisila looked up slowly, "Uh- yeah...a lot...but that's not your problem." She sighed. Stephanie let go of the door handle and turned towards Cisila, "It isn't good to keep your feelings all bottled up, y'know." She said. Cisila looked up at her and frowned again. "I hardly know you. I don't think I should...speak about my relationship problems to someone I met standing next to a corpse." 

"But-" Stephanie tried to say.

"...Out. Please." Cisila said. She sounded tired, and she put her face in her hands again. Stephanie relented, and opened the door.

*I wonder what's wrong.* She thought, stepping out into the hallway. Now all she had to do was sneak back into her room, at home.

#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 26

Cisila pulled her face out of her hands again and picked up her phone. She opened the contacts and quickly found Lyla's number. While she was trying to get everything she could out of that Stephanie girl, Lyla had sent a message: *Sorry to be abrupt, but it looks like I need to leave for a little while. A month, at least. I know I don't like it, but for now, our relationship is on hold.* She had written. Calling Lyla, she held the phone up to the side of her head. "Lyla..." Cisila said, spinning around in her chair to face the shelves behind her. "Yeah- yeah, I'm sorry." Lyla said. "It's really important. I'm really sorry." She sighed, "I haven't been able to do much recently, and it's...well, it's part of why I'm going. I didn't want to keep dragging you on and on, so..." She paused. "Yeah- I...I think we've just gotta...stop. For now." Cisila leaned back in her chair and sighed deeply, fidgeting with a large coin she'd found. "It's- it's fine." Cisila said. "I get it." She didn't really get it. Lyla, for whatever reason, suddenly had so many trips to random places. And this was probably the worst of them. A month of not having Lyla was like a month where Cisila didn't have a purpose in life. "I'm...really going to be alone, though." She admitted. "You'll be alright..." Lyla said. "There's...there's a lot of people to talk to." Lyla sounded extremely tired, barely able to string words together. Cisila didn't want to make her more tired, so she decided to try and end the conversation as soon as she could. "Well, I...I won't *die* without you." Cisila said, "But...I also...I really can't guarantee that I won't..." she sighed. "I think I know what you mean." Lyla said. "Look- if...if you need someone...if you decide you like someone else..." She paused. Cisila fidgeted with the coin more, her fingers tensing up. Her fingers rubbed against the warm metal of the coin. "Lyla..." Cisila mumbled. "What's wrong?" \
Lyla breathed in deeply. "It's- it's nothing. I'm just...it might not take just a month. I could be gone for a lot longer, and I..." she paused again. "I just want you to be happy, so if there's...someone else you're happy with, that's- that's cool." She muttered. "Right..." Cisila said, feeling down. "Thank you." Lyla sighed, and finally finished the conversation. "Look- I love you. But I'm going to be gone for so long, and I..." Cisila raised an eyebrow in confusion, before Lyla suddenly dropped a bomb. "I might not come back." Lyla said. "What?" Cisila said, her expression going from the numb sadness she was feeling to worry. Confusion. "Lyla- what?" She repeated. "Lyla, what the fuck do you mean?! You-" But she was met with the beep of a hang up. She was left sitting in her chair with the phone up to her ear, frozen. *What does she mean?* Her mind echoed. *What could that possibly mean? Is she going to...die? Where even is she to begin with?* Cisila hadn't seen Lyla all week.

Worry sudden overtook her. She put her phone down, and got up from her chair. Lyla hadn't shown up in a week, and that enough had made her worry a little. But now it was bad. Lyla had basically said she could die. This wasn't a normal trip. This wasn't for Lyla's job. It wasn't even for family, or vacation...it was something else altogether. And it was like Lyla was telling her to find someone else so she wouldn't wait for a dead Lyla to return. Why? *Why* was this happening? What had Lyla been up to? She knew that only two years ago, she had been working under threat of blackmail for Cisila's ex-boyfriend, Mikhail. It was Lyla who had given her the scars on her cheek. Lyla had been through so much, and for her to up and disappear was strange. She wouldn't do that...not voluntarily. At least, Cisila *thought* she wouldn't. Surely. But it seemed like Lyla...Lyla was already gone. And she couldn't stop Lyla from leaving. Beginning to pace around the small office, Cisila couldn't push the worry out of her head. *What happened? What happened?* The question bounced around in her head, and she wasn't able to stop it. *Breathe!* She reminded herself, and she began to slow down. *Breathe.* She repeated. *It's fine. There's nothing you can do, which means there's no reason to freak out over it.* Despite this being a terrible fact, it did calm her down. *Okay.* She thought. *You need to turn your head back to the case at hand.* And with that, Cisila slowly sat back down at her desk and began to pour over everything she had already gathered on the crime, looking for details she may have missed. Pulling out pictures of the murder sites, she laid them all out on her desk. Each site was different, and including the one she'd just found, courtesy of the Stephanie girl, there were six. Six different people, murdered. Cisila was unable to find any relation between the murder victims, aside from two. The first one was a vice president of a medical company, and had been visiting Chicago for a press meeting. The murderer had caught him going to his hotel after the press meeting ended, and killed him in the alleyway, stealing his heart. The fourth victim, the only one related, was a scientist from the same medical company. The company, named Sakura Medical, was developing some kind of drug, which the vice president and the scientist had both been connected to, but Cisila was unable to find any other connections. It seemed like the murderer just wanted to inconvenience this drug, which was marketed as a sleep assistant, so Cisila couldn't really see a problem with it. And as far as she was concerned, the rest of the victims had no connections between each other. 

Each site was picked randomly, it seemed, on the night of the murder. In the first victim's case, it had been the alleyway. In the second victim's case, it had been an empty park. Places where there was nobody, at times where the murderer couldn't be seen. It was standard. Cisila had only been able to get to the crime scenes after the police had - aside from the newest victim, whom she had yet to look at the wallet and phone she'd taken - and wasn't able to get any evidence. There was no way for her to go through the victim's phones to find out what they were doing, nor could she look at CCTV footage. All of it had been admitted into police evidence...aside from the two things she'd taken from the newest victim. She set down the wallet and phone of the victim on her desk, and stared at the man's ID card again. *Mason Lard*, it read. He was thirty when he died, judging from his birthdate. She slowly went through the wallet, pulling out a credit card (which she avoided using), coupons, and a card belonging to a company. *Ah.* She thought. *Here we go. Something of use.* Cisila read the name on the card, and made a mental note of it. *Carbine Industries,* it read. She'd take a look at the company later, after she got some sleep. It was futile to try and find a connection between the victims, if there was even any, aside from the two Sakura Medical employees, but Cisila couldn't stop herself. Until she found out for sure that there was no connection, she would keep trying to find one. And the best way to do that, unfortunately, was to go to the police. But her client strongly disagreed with going to the police, and as she had put it, *"If you have to, break in and steal the evidence. They can't know."* she had said. Cisila would have to either go against her client's wishes, or break into the police HQ. For the third time in her life. Coming to this realization, she leaned back in her chair, and sighed. *Though, there is something else I could do.* She thought, but she already knew it wasn't a good idea. *I could wait for another murder. I could be there when it happens.* But *how* would she do such a thing? When? Cisila had no idea if or when another murder would happen, and a detective who sat around waiting for another murder to happen wasn't a very useful detective. *Maybe Kasey would help...* She thought, reaching for her phone. But she stopped. *I don't want to bug her.* She lowered her hand. *Kasey's on vacation, seeing her old friends. I don't want to drag her into this.* Shaking her head, Cisila put her face into her hands once more. *There's got to be something I can do. Surely.* \
But as she thought harder and harder, Cisila realized she really couldn't avoid breaking into the police station. She needed details that only the police had, including the murderer's appearance. The victim's wallets and phones. She *needed* them to continue her investigation, and without them, it would come to a grinding halt. Her client's money wasted. 

*But...there's somewhere else I can go.* She realized. *Somewhere I've never been. Somewhere I know I can get information.* Pulling her face out of her hands, she remembered something Kasey had told her once. *"There's a club," Kasey had said one time during a conversation, "What the fuck is it called...La Lune Brillante? There's this brilliant informant there. For the right price, you can find shit out that the police don't know. Things they won't know."* La Lune Brillante...if that informant was still there, maybe she could learn things without going to the police HQ. At least at first...it was worth trying. *I've got to figure out where the fuck this place even is, though.* She thought, getting up from her chair again. Zephyr might know where the place was...assuming Cisila could get a hold of him. Picking up her phone and heading towards the door, Cisila called Zephyr as she stepped out into the hallway and headed down to the lobby. It took a few minutes for him to answer, but he picked up. "Cisila?" Zephyr said, sounding tired over the phone. "I need some help." Cisila muttered, heading out of the lobby and onto the cold, damp street soaked in neon lights. "There's this club- 'La Lune Brillante', I think? I need to get into it for a case."

#### STEPHANIE LAYTON, 23

As quietly as she could, Stephanie climbed up the roof of her mother's two story suburban home. Stephanie's room was on the second floor, and she knew her window was unlocked. Tip-toeing across the damp, shingled roof, Stephanie pulled open the window to her room. It slid upwards with a horrible grinding noise, which she tried to keep as quiet as she could. *Fuuuck.* She thought, climbing in slowly. Setting her feet down on the floor as quietly as she could, Stephanie slid her shoes off. The less noise she made, the better. Her mother certainly didn't want to see her...and at this rate, Stephanie wanted to see her even less. Looking around her room, Stephanie lifted her sunglasses up. All she needed was her laptop, water bottle, and a couple of books. And then she would leave. Her job would support her and...she was *pretty* sure a couple of her friends would let her stay with them. But right now...all Stephanie needed to focus on was pretending not to exist. Tip-toeing across her room, she picked up her laptop from her desk. Her room was painted in boyish colours, which she had always disliked. Red walls. Her dad's memorabilia that she had inherited was strewn across the walls. Posters of soccer players, baseball players, and old vintage movies. It was her dad's way of helping her- hiding her true interests from her mother. Her dad always loved her, despite her mother's insistence on not treating her like a human being. He knew her mother was a bad person, and tried to help Stephanie as much as she could. He was part of why she looked like how she felt now. Sliding her laptop slowly into her satchel, she went to pick up her water bottle. It was plastered in stickers, and looking at it, she frowned. It was really her only belonging that showed her true interests, and it was battered. A dent was in it, which hadn't been there yesterday morning. Sighing and quietly putting it into her satchel, Stephanie pulled her notebooks off of her desk aswell and slid them into her satchel, along with her pencil case. Looking around her room again, she tried to think if she needed anything else. Frowning at the pictures on her bedside table, she decided that, no, she didn't need anything else. There wasn't anything that really belonged to her here that she couldn't buy again if she needed it. There wasn't really anyone she wanted to see before leaving, either. Maria had clearly been manipulated by her mother in order to actually tell Stephanie not to come back. Slowly making her way towards the window again, and about to put her shoes on, Stephanie heard a noise, and her entire body froze involuntarily. It was the click of the door knob moving. Slowly, the door to her room opened with a subtle creak. Light from the outside hallway flooded in, like water filling up a tank. A tank Stephanie would end up drowning in if she stayed too long. She forcefully slid her shoes on, and winced, her heels grinding against the back of the shoes. She reached towards the window, about to climb out, when a voice stopped her. 

"...Did Maria not tell you, or are you *fucking* deaf?" Her mother hissed from the entrance of her room. She sounded angry. Angrier than usual. Stephanie didn't move her head, but she did pull her sunglasses back over her eyes. The light made her eyes water. Her eyes were much, *much* too sensitive. Maria's were, too. "Hey." Her mother said. "*Are* you deaf? I know you can hear me." Stephanie slowly turned her head to look back at her mother's silhouette, shrouded in light. "I was just leaving." Stephanie muttered. "And I *told* you-" Her mother began, "Well, told *Maria-* that you weren't to come the fuck back." Stephanie sighed, and her mother took a step forward. "Don't give me that attitude." She hissed, "I don't know what's fucking gotten into you, but I've had enough." *Stephanie* was the one who had had enough. She let go of the window, and turned to face her mother aggressively. If she was leaving, then whatever she said next wouldn't matter. After years of torment from this woman, she could finally let it out. Stephanie stared into her mother's eyes. Her mother's hair was frazzled, brown, tied into a ponytail. Her face, like Stephanie's, was thin. But she looked gaunt compared to Stephanie. Anger was etched across her mother's face, as it always seemed to be when she looked at Stephanie. As she stared, her mother backpedaled a bit, taking a step back. "Shut the fuck up." Stephanie hissed. "*Shut. The fuck. Up.*" She repeated. Her mother's expression went from anger, to shock. "*What-*" She grunted, "You're not allowed to talk to me like that, you goddamn-" Stephanie cut her off again. She would *not* let her mother insult her again. "I told you to *shut* the *fuck* up, Mom." She began, "I probably shouldn't even call you that. You're just a goddamned piece of shit, and I'm tired of pretending you aren't." She flung her arms out, "It's always 'fuck off' this, 'buy us dinner' that!" Her mother recoiled, taking yet another step back. "What the hell am I to you, even? I don't get it." \
Her mother cocked her head to the side and raised her voice. "You're- you're a goddamn *freak*. That's what you are." She spat, "I don't know what happened to you. I don't know why you felt like you had to be a girl, but I still- I still look at you, and see my boy. My real child. What happened to that? Huh?" Her mother took hold of the conversation and took a step forward. "Why do you feel the need to disrespect me just because I don't think you're a fucking girl? You're dillusional." She started to go on a spiel of why Stephanie was wrong, and why she, her *mother,* was right. Stephanie just watched in shock as she continued to say ridiculous things...things that weren't true. But she couldn't stop her mother. "...And then suddenly, after *all* of that, you come up to me-" Her mother pointed to herself, and raised her voice even louder. "And you tell me YOU THINK YOU'RE A GIRL?!" She shrieked. Stephanie had backed up against the window, and she was shaking. She thought she had the energy to overpower her mother, but the overpowering voice of her mother had proven otherwise. "YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT? YOU EXPECT ME TO BE *OKAY* WITH THAT?" Her mother continued to shriek. "I JUST WANT YOU *OUT.* AND YOU'RE STILL DISOBEYING ME? AFTER ALL THIS FUCKING TIME? AFTER *ALL* I'VE FUCKING PUT UP WITH?" Stephanie felt her heartrate increasing, and her breathing getting faster. Her grip on the window sill was tightening, her knuckles turning white. Her mother finally stopped, her face red. Stephanie stared into her mother's malicious eyes. Blinking, Stephanie realized this was her chance. This was her only chance. "I AM *DONE* PUTTING UP WITH THIS." Her mother shrieked again, "I-" But the next time her mother opened her mouth, Stephanie overtook her. "**I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!**" She yelled in her mother's face. Her breathing had gotten heavier. "WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?" She began to shake harder as she let go of the window, "WHY IS IT SUCH A BIG DEAL WHEN I CHOOSE A WAY TO LIVE? IT'S NOT *YOUR* LIFE." Her mother stared at her. "You're right." Her mother said. "It's not my life." She cocked her head to the side, "But you're my child. Or are you? I can't fucking tell. The boy I gave birth to has disintegrated, and this pink...this pink and black- *abomination* has appeared in his place." She hissed. Stephanie opened her mouth to say something, but couldn't find the words. "I'm done." Her mother said. "I'm done listening to your excuses. Get out." 

Stephanie's mind had gone numb, like it had in the fighting ring. Her anger clouded her thoughts, and there was only one thing her mind was thinking. *Punch her. Punch her. She deserves it, doesn't she? Punch her.* Her mother continued to stare at her, waiting for Stephanie to walk past her quietly and obediently. But she didn't. Instead, in one swift movement, Stephanie went in for an uppercut. All of her strength went into it, but...her mother stopped it. In a surprising showcase of strength, her mother caught Stephanie's uppercut before her fist slammed into her mother's chin. Making a small squeak from surprise, Stephanie began to struggle. Her mother turned Stephanie around forcefully and shoved her towards the entrance of the door. "*Leave.*" Her mother hissed. Stephanie looked at her mother. "No." Stephanie protested. "I'm not going, no matter how much you tell me to. I'm *done* listening to y-" But she was stopped midsentence by her mother delivering a painful *slap* to her face. Stephanie's glasses flew off her face and clattered against the ground. Her thoughts faded away as she was left in the moment, in shock. Her mother had slapped her. \
As quickly as her mother could muster, she walked around Stephanie and slammed the door shut behind her. Stephanie stood there in silence, her mouth hanging open in disbelief. Slowly, she raised her hand to her cheek, feeling the sting from her mother's slap. It *hurt.* She'd never done that before. But...it was Stephanie's fault. She'd let her anger take over, and she'd almost broke her mother's jaw. In her defense, she couldn't stop herself. How could a parent treat their child like that? What was *so* wrong with Stephanie that her mother hated her very guts? Blinking back tears, Stephanie kneeled down and picked up her sunglasses, and slid them back over her nose. The dark lenses and side shields of the frameless glasses hid her eyes as tears began to well up. Walking over to the window slowly, she grabbed onto the window sill, extremely tightly. *Fuck.* She thought, letting go and punching the sill as hard as she could. It didn't make her feel better as her knuckles dug into the wood of the sill. It made her feel worse. She couldn't stop herself from crying as she climbed out of the window and slammed it shut. There was no reason to stay quiet. There was no reason to *care.* Her mother had loved her all the way up until Stephanie became a girl. And then it was insults, labour, and ignorance. *Why* did her mother have to be like this? Stephanie climbed down the roof and landed in front of the porch. Looking back, she saw her mother looking out from one of the living room windows, silhouetted. Stephanie couldn't see her expression, and her mother couldn't see her own. She sniffed, and cried harder, looking away.

She sat on a bench in the middle of an empty park, scrolling on her phone. It was raining softly, and Stephanie kept having to wipe her screen off. Eventually, she turned her phone off and put it away. She pulled her glasses off and buried her face in her hands. *Fuck.* She thought.
