#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 26

Above the pinpricks of light on the earth below, a private jet smoothly glides over the clear night sky, its engines whirring as it cuts through the wind. Inside, its lights are on, along with the red and green position lights, which blink every so often. Above, the stars twinkle, while other aircraft far above the private jet can be seen, their position lights also blinking, far away. The jet carries only four people. The two pilots, calmly watching their instruments and keeping an eye on the sky through their cabin's windows. One is eating dinner, while the other has their hands on the yoke, the control column for the jet's ailerons, aswell as its ability to ascend and descend. It's a quiet night. On the interior of the main cabin, the jet's two passengers sit quietly. One has her hands linked together, deep in thought. The other is writing down notes. The first one looks up at the other. A plume of hair covers the right side of her face, and a pair of scars scrape up from her jaw, to her cheek. Cisila Jane Siveta, twenty-six. And the other, as she looks up, is Kasey. The two are on a trip out of Illinois, to a neighbouring state. It's been a year since PALMER-EDEN collapsed, and now, America's economy seems to be powering back up, not being bottlenecked by a company controlling everything. Things are looking up. Cisila and Kasey have opened a detective business, and this trip is for that business. A job that sounds big, had a big payment...it had all the signs that it was legit. But Cisila had her doubts. So did Kasey, but the two couldn't turn it down. Something about the case irked Cisila. It was almost like they'd gotten the case because of it...Cisila picked up the case file off the small table in the cabin, and opened it. A bunch of pictures were inside, and one of them, sent by the client, was of Cisila's sister. *She went missing.* Her mind echoed, as she pulled the picture out and stared at it. *It's definitely her, too. The client said so. Seems like he wasn't aware she's my sister, though...* It was suspicious, coming to an Illinois detective, but perhaps it was his only option. He seemed severely disgruntled when he appeared, and explained he couldn't go back. But that someone in the town of Lakelight in Iowa desperately needed their help. And even stranger, they'd already paid for a private jet. The one they were on now. Cisila looked up at Kasey, and opened her mouth. "...Kasey, who are we meeting?" She asked. Kasey blinked, "Gah, uh..." She mumbled, "Turns out, uh..." Kasey rubbed her eyes, "S'just a guy I used to know. A detective. Seems like he sent someone to come and get me in particular..." She leaned back in her seat and yawned. Kasey was wearing a large trench coat over her traditional outfit, which now had maroon red button-up shirt, black vest, and a black tie. Cisila had on something new she decided to try, hearing that Iowa was going to be mostly rainy, and, for some reason, cold. A long-sleeve shirt in her usual purple, along with a very dark purple vest. She had her necklace on. Her pants were a much darker grey, and she had a belt on that held a few pouches, and a holster for a pistol she'd decided to buy. 

Of course, she could still Construct her forty-four revolver, but this new pistol was a Hammerhead "Niner", a conventional 9mm pistol that fired in a semi-automatic mode, and due to the threat of PALMER-EDEN and her identity being discovered, she'd never wanted to buy a weapon while she was possibly being watched. Now, she had nothing to be afraid of. Cisila also had a new pair of shoes on, akin to hiking shoes. They were mostly black and brown. "Uh...right." Cisila muttered, sliding the picture back into the case file, before putting it back down on the table. "What *is* Lakelight, anyways?" She asked. Kasey shrugged, "Some junktown in the middle of nowhere." She said, sitting up. "One of the few towns in the country that still don't have the internet everywhere. I even read that..." Kasey smiled, "...they've still got stores from the *nineties."* Cisila snorted, "From the nineties? Like what?" Cisila wasn't really familiar with the generation of the 1990s, or in fact, the 2000s. She was born too late to understand anything, and even the 2010s eluded her. Her childhood was very, very confusing. Kasey shook her head, "No idea. Not even the slightest. They have one of the only 'Blockbusters' still in existence. What the hell's a Blockbuster?" She muttered to herself. Cisila shrugged, and leaned back in her chair. "So...this case." She started to say. "A bunch of missing people in an area with a cult." Kasey nodded, and Cisila continued. "Possible murders, along with a weird series of-" she pondered the correct word, "...murals? Dedicated to the ramblings of a madman." Again, Kasey nodded, but added, "And your sister fits in there, somewhere." Cisila crossed her arms, and shut her eyes. Her sister, someone she hadn't seen in years, had suddenly disappeared in the middle of nowhere. And it didn't feel like a coincidence that she was going right to where her sister disappeared, looking for her. Of course, Cisila couldn't just say it wasn't a coincidence, but it felt odd nonetheless. Silently, Cisila turned her head to look out the private jet's window. The man who'd paid for the flight...another detective. Probably someone older, with more experience. So why did he need Kasey and herself? Was there something in this town that was *that* bad? The ground below the jet was pitch black, as they flew closer to the middle of nowhere. Out of the blue, the speakers *dinged* as one of the pilots picked up the comms system. Through the crackly system, the pilot spoke. "We're about ten minutes from the landing strip, just so you two know. Once we land, we'll disembark. We're to stay in town as long as you're there, so, uh...hope you aren't staying too long." They said, over the comms. Cisila snorted, and Kasey smiled. "I wouldn't want to stay there that long anyways..." Kasey muttered. "Actually," Cisila spoke up, looking at Kasey, "Where are we going first?" She asked. "Oh..." Kasey mumbled, "Diner in town. Only one there." *Only one whole diner in the town...?* Cisila's mind echoed. *Jesus, this place sounds sad.*

The jet continued towards the small town, and after ten minutes, just like the pilot said, the jet touched down with a soft *thud* on the tarmac of the solitary airstrip, just outside of the town. Slowly, the jet rolled to a stop, its landing gear smoothly rolling along the bumpy, cracking tarmac. The strip was surrounded by trees, but there was plenty of space for aircraft to land. The trees, however, pierced the twinkling night sky like sharp points, blocking stars out. It was like being surrounded by a large, pointy wall of complete darkness. Cisila and Kasey got up from their seats as the jet finally stopped and its cabin door opened, the stairs extending out. Cisila went up to the pilot's cabin, and opened the door. "Thanks." She said, looking at the two pilots. They looked back and nodded, "No idea why you're being flown here, but, hey, have fun." One of them said. Cisila smiled, "We'll try to. Hope you don't die of boredom. See you." She replied, before shutting the door. Cisila walked down the stairs and onto the dark tarmac strip, with Kasey. Kasey grumbled, fumbling through her trench coat. "No lights at all..." She muttered, which wasn't entirely true. Like most airstrips, lights lined the landing area to help pilots land properly. But they didn't really provide any light for Cisila and Kasey to see, so Kasey pulled out a flashlight. Clicking it on, she aimed it around. "Nobody else here..." Kasey sighed, and Cisila pulled out her own flashlight, and clicked it on aswell. The two looked around for any semblance of place to go, before spotting a small building on the far end of the airstrip. The lights were on. Cisila began walking over to it, using her flashlight to keep herself on the airstrip. Kasey followed, and soon enough, the two entered the small building. It looked like a small registration area for aircraft, and when Cisila pushed the door open and clicked her flashlight off, the door *dinged*. The only attendant in the room looked up from their desk, and smiled. "Good evening!" She chirped, beckoning Cisila and Kasey over. "I'm assuming you're the ones that Dougson called, yeah?" She had clearly dyed her hair, as it was a violent pink melting into black. She had a nose piercing, aswell. Her face was thin, but nonetheless, was full of life. "You don't need to register anything, then...Dougson did that for you."

Cisila cocked her head, "Uh...right. Where do we go, though?" She asked. The girl behind the desk laughed, "Oh, jeez, not from here...right, yeah..." She muttered, "We don't get a lot of people like that. My job's pretty boring." Cisila sighed. The girl pulled out a large map from one of the drawers in her desk, and handed it to Cisila. "Old school out here. Hope you can read a map." She chirped, as Cisila took the map. Her father had taught her to teach maps, so she'd at least be able to find her way around. But, already, Cisila felt like she had gone back in time. There were no modern oddities sitting around. It was like this town was completely isolated from the modern day. A fat CRT TV sat on a table inside, buzzing with static. "...Is that thing on?" Cisila asked, pointing at the TV. "What?" The girl asked, before looking back. "Oh. Yeah. Musta forgot to turn it off..." She sighed. "Anyway- Name's Stephanie. You can call me Steph, though." She looked at Cisila and smiled again. There was a strange look in her eyes...Cisila shook her head, trying to hide a frown. "Yeah. Thanks." Cisila muttered. "Well, uh," she looked around, "see you later, I guess." she mumbled. "Mhm." Steph chirped, and Cisila left the small building, and noticed that Kasey had left before her. She was leaning against one of the walls and smoking a cigarette. "That girl's into you." Kasey said. Cisila frowned. "I could tell." She said. "She was looking at me weird..." Cisila pulled out her own pack of cigarettes, pulled one out, and lit it, beginning to smoke. "Bit of an oddball." She muttered. "Don't know why she locked on immediately." Kasey snorted, "Yeah, right. Sure." she said. Cisila grumbled, "She's pretty at least." But she wouldn't go near her. She held her right hand up, and looked at the little ring on her ring finger. "Not an excuse, though..." She muttered, lowering her hand. She snuffed the cigarette out, "Can we go, please?" She said. "I don't like being out at night in a forest." Kasey snuffed her own cigarette out, and pulled her flashlight out. "Me neither. Let's go." She said, and the two headed off towards a path marked on the map, that headed straight for the town. As they got onto the path and left the airstrip behind, the sounds of the forest around them took over. Leaves rustled as the wind mades its way through the forest, and the two could hear scuttering as they made their way down the path, probably from small animals like squirrels. Cisila and Kasey's flashlights shone the way forward, but other than those, there were no lights. The moon above them weakly reflected light from the sun.

"I hate this already." Cisila grumbled. Kasey laughed. "Come on!" She said, "The pay's insane. I don't know why Dougson is paying us this much, but it's worth it." Kasey may have been right, but the fact that her sister was part of the case immensely irked Cisila. It *couldn't* have been a coincidence, but all signs pointed to it. Cisila pushed it out of her head. "I guess..." She muttered. The two continued along the path, before they both stopped suddenly. A pair of headlights rolled down the path. Kasey clicked her flashlight off, latched onto Cisila's arm and tugged her off the path. Kasey seemed to trip over something as Cisila turned her flashlight off, and the two were flung down into a ditch, colliding with dirt and plants. Cisila, disoriented, pulled herself up after she landed, next to Kasey. "What- what the fuck was that for?!" She sputtered at Kasey. Kasey sat up against a tree, "...Just be quiet for a moment. There's something I forgot to explain..." She muttered, as the large vehicle rolled by. It seemed to have missed them. The engine rumbled loudly. Cisila slid over to Kasey, barely able to see her in the dark. "Dougson warned me about trucks down that path." Kasey said. "They're all from that cult he wants to look into. They go down to the airstrip when a new aircraft lands." Kasey leaned back against the tree, "I don't know what they do, but we can't be seen by them." Cisila looked back up at the path, and narrowed her eyes. "...So if we're getting out of our way, does that mean they're violent?" She asked. "Maybe," Kasey responded, "But Dougson seemed nervous about them when I asked. Says the night's dangerous." Cisila's brow furrowed, and her lip twitched. "Why the hell'd he bring us out here on a late flight, then?!" She hissed. Kasey shrugged, and got up. "I think they're gone." She said. "Let's get back on the path and get to the town." Kasey climbed back out of the ditch, and Cisila followed.

-

Finally, after nearly twenty minutes of walking, and occasional hiding from trucks, the two made it to the town. Old roads stretched through the town, crackling. Buildings clearly from the nineties with next to no upkeep were the first things the two saw, on the main street as they walked down the empty road. On one side was an old theatre, its lights still on. The main attraction, at least the last one advertised, at the theater was the movie *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Cisila snorted, seeing the poster. "Wasn't kidding. Stuck in the past." She muttered. Kasey shook her head, "Can we focus? I think the diner's just over there." She said. "Yeah. Right." Cisila muttered, and Kasey hopped onto the sidewalk on the other side, heading towards a diner that looked straight out of the 1950s. As they drew closer, Cisila noticed that it was beginning to rain softly. The diner was one of the few things on the main street that was still lit brightly, its signage glowing a bright neon red. Its lights were on, casting a soft orange glow on the whole interior. Kasey climbed up the steps to the entrance and walked in, followed by Cisila. The door, just like the registration building, softly *dinged* as the two entered. There was a solitary employee at the counter, and he looked tired. "Hey." He muttered, "Good evening. Pull up some chairs'n I'll take your order..." Cisila nodded, before looking around. "Dougson's here?" She asked. "Yeah." Kasey replied, pointing at a man sitting at a corner table. He looked exactly like Cisila thought a detective would appear to be. Grizzled, tired, in his forties. Kasey walked over and took a seat at the corner table, followed by Cisila. Dougson looked up, "Ah. Nice." he muttered, "You're here. Okay." He put his phone away, which he was looking at. "First of all, thanks for coming out here at all." He said. His voice was gravelly. "If I'm being honest, I only called because I knew Kasey here." He looked at Kasey, then at Cisila. "But as I've been told, it seems some kind of morbid coincidence happened." *My sister.* Cisila's mind echoed. "Yes." She said. "I know she disappeared here." Her sister's disappearance left her feeling empty, but Dougson didn't seem quite as concerned. "She's not the only one. For months now, people have been disappearing. This...this cult thing's been having some kind of surge, and it's impossible to tell what they do. It's dangerous to go out at night. It's dangerous to go out even at sunset. They're trying to keep all of us inside, and for what reason, I've no idea." Dougson rattled off. Cisila stopped him, "Sorry- uh- why'd you get us a late flight if you knew the night was dangerous?" She asked. "We almost got caught by some of those people," Kasey added. "Just like you said." Dougson looked at them, rubbing his chin. "Yeah, sorry about that." He said. "I couldn't get an earlier one." Cisila sighed, and leaned back in her chair. "However, I've got a house here, so you don't need to worry about accomodations. I expect our investigation to take about a week, because I've collected a *hell* of a lot of evidence, and I just need more boots on the ground to find the last pieces." He explained.

"Right." Cisila said, "What've you got?" she leaned forward, anticipating Dougson's next words. Looking around carefully, Dougson also leaned forward, lowering his voice. "The cult believes the writings of a madman, like I put in the case file. But there were a lot of other things I couldn't put in there, for fear of being discovered. They kill. They kill a *lot.*" He began, and Cisila felt her heart drop. "Ritualistic murders, strewn up and siphoned of their blood. They use it as paint, to make those murals. Every kill is calculated, and follows the writing to a T." *Strange.* Her mind echoed. Dougson took a sip of his drink and continued, clearing his throat. "I've also been told, uh..." he paused briefly, "...ghosts. Apparently. In the old hospital out north. Or at least, some kind of supernatural shit. I'm being swamped with requests to look there by everybody else, but if I'm being honest..." he sighed, "Place gives me the heebie-jeebies. I don't like going into old buildings." Kasey snorted, "Classic." She leaned forward aswell, "But I'm guessing there's more." Dougson nodded, "Damn right. I know for a fact that what we're looking for is their next murder site. If we can catch them there, it's over for them." Cisila nodded, listening carefully, as Dougson continued. "The disappearances coordinate aswell in timing, and location. Everything is planned. *Everything.* And those plans don't change, so if we find out their next murder site, we can stop them before it even goes through. And lucky for you two, I've already got a start. There's a local gang in town that tends to cause a lot of problems..." he pulled out a Polaroid photo and slid it out across the table. It was of a woman, in her thirties. She had on an eyepatch. "This is their leader. I'm suspecting she's part of the cult. She had no alibi for the disappearances. She refused to cooperate. If they're trying to be subtle, this isn't it." He tapped the photo, "But if you can get your hands on her, I bet you can force the location out of her." Kasey picked up the photo, and spoke up. "...Where is she, though?" she asked. "Excellent question," Dougson muttered. "Tomorrow night, at an old factory, the gang's holding a large...er...whatchamacallit- a rave. They turned the factory into a giant fuck-off nightclub, completely operated by them. If you can get in, she'll for sure be there. But, well...the problem's getting in." 

"Don't worry." Cisila said, "We're good at getting into places we're not supposed to be."

Dougson snorted, "Yeah. I bet. Come on, let's head to my place. You can rest up and get yourselves ready. I want to get through this as fast as possible."

Cisila and Kasey carefully approached the large, dilapidated factory. But it looked alive. Blinding red, blue, and green lights flashed out of the windows, the first illumination that the factory had seen in years. The music blared through the very walls, seeping out of the concrete. The two had made their way through the forest surrounding the small town, using the map Cisila had been given as a guide. The factory was out of the way of the main roads, hidden by the trees. "...This is it, then." Kasey muttered, stepping out of the clearing. Cisila followed, folding the map and putting it away. "Windows might be our best bet," She said, raising her voice. Even outside, the music filled their ears. Cisila nodded, and quickly walked up to the factory wall, letting her grapple gun Construct on her arm. She flung her arm up and aimed for one of the windows, firing the grapple. It hooked onto the metal beams of the window and Cisila pulled herself up, letting the cable reel back in. Getting onto the top, she settled herself down and shot the grapple back down into the ground, giving Kasey a line to climb up on. Kasey quickly latched on and climbed upwards, her weight pulling Cisila forward slightly. Eventually, Kasey got to the top, and Cisila helped her up. "Perfect." Kasey said, looking through the window. The glass had long shattered, which would let them crawl through. But through the window, they could see the giant factory-turned-club inside. The lights were even more blinding- flashing blue, red and green. The interior of the factory had been renovated to hell and back, and no longer looked anything like a factory...it looked more like what it was supposed to be. An expensive club. Tiled black floor, slick walls, and a *hell* of a lot of people. Way more than Cisila thought there'd be, and as the two slid through the window and dropped down into the club, they saw that not only were there a lot of partygoers, but a staggering amount of security from the gang. "Shit," Cisila hissed, "If they see us..." Kasey shook her head. "They'll find us either way. Just go." She said, and started walking towards the main part of the club, under the flashing lights. Cisila reluctantly followed, her eyes at the ground, but she was paying attention to her peripheral vision. Nobody was looking at her. The two made their way through the crowd dancing, when Cisila noticed that...rain was falling from the ceiling. Drenching everything. Looking up, she saw that the gang must have repurposed the old fire sprinklers. 

Kasey paved the way through the crowd, looking back at Cisila. "Where the hell did all these people come from?" She said, with her voice raised. Cisila could barely hear her. "Probably just people from the town-" She guessed. "Keep going. We've got to find that woman." She made her way past Kasey and headed up a set of stairs, where water was trickling down. Once they got to the top of the steps, onto the second level of the factory, they saw a giant art sculpture. *Art.* Her mind echoed. *Barely.*  It was a mess of neon beams, twisted and forced into awkward places on the ceiling, creating awkward lighting down on the floor. Even more people were on this floor, mindlessly dancing. Kasey stopped behind her, "Wait-" She said, and Cisila paused. "We've been spotted." Kasey hissed. And she seemed to be right. Gang members were forcing their way through the crowd, making their way towards Cisila and Kasey. "Do they know...?!" Cisila muttered, pulling back towards Kasey. Almost immediately, the first gang member to get to them threw his fists towards Cisila, seeming to know exactly who their targets were. Cisila caught his punch by his arm, wheeled him around and knocked him to the floor. She broke his arm and stomped on his face before pulling out his Hammerhead Niner. "Yeah, they seem to know who we are!" She yelled over the music, which began to blare even louder. "Can we hurry this up and find her?!" Cisila yelled at Kasey. "Yes! Come on." Kasey replied, pulling out one of her pistols. "Let's split up. More ground covered. Go that way!" Kasey pointed her pistol towards the crowd, deeper into the factory. "I'll head the other way." Cisila nodded, and took off through the crowd, who somehow hadn't noticed the commotion. They were still mindlessly dancing, and to Cisila, it was odd. *They could just be high off their minds...* Her mind echoed. But as she held onto her Hammerhead Niner, every thought faded away. Her mind zeroed in on her goal: The gang leader. She had no idea what the layout of the factory was, but Cisila knew that the leader must have taken some kind of vantage point in the factory. Continuing to push her way through the large crowds, Cisila pulled her pistol's suppressor off her toolbelt and screwed it on: she'd rather avoid making too much noise, and as more gang members forced their way towards her, Cisila fired at their legs, causing them to trip and fall. They couldn't get up fast enough to find her, and as Cisila rushed up yet another set of stairs, onto the third floor, she saw more gang members rush down the stairs she was heading up.

It was like they had all locked onto her. It was like...they *knew* she was coming. As she pulled the trigger on her pistol several more times, and slid out of the way of the tumbling members, who crashed down the stairs after being shot in the leg, Cisila began to worry about Kasey. There was far more security than the two had thought, and Cisila wasn't sure if Kasey could handle all of this. As Cisila got onto the third floor, she reached into her vest and pulled out a magazine, dumping her pistol's empty one and shoving the fresh one into the magwell. She racked the slide, and looked around. The third floor was the largest, and most open. Floodlights of many colours filled the area with an intense feeling, as dozens upon dozens of people continued to dance, unaware of everything around them. The rusting roof above them had holes poked through it, letting the night seep in. The sprinklers on this floor were also on, casting the room with a soft mist of water. At the far end of the large, open area...was a stage. A large one, with over the top speakers and music equipment on it. The brightest lights shone down on the stage, where a solitary DJ mixed the music together. But it wasn't just the DJ...on a higher part of the stage, a ridiculously oversized throne was bolted into the floor. Parts of scrap metal were screwed into the throne, giving it strange, warped wings of steel. Sitting in it...was a woman. Cisila pulled the photo of the gang leader that Dougson had given them out of her vest, and looked at it. From the distance she was at, Cisila couldn't tell who if this was the woman, but the air of arrogance that came from the large throne above everybody made it feel obvious. Slowly, Cisila walked down the steps onto the large dance floor, and started to make her way through the crowd. Nobody would move out of her way. She had to force people out of her way as she sped up, making a path for herself. As she got closer and closer, Cisila got an idea. Her brow furrowed, looking at the large speaker systems. If she could take those out, the entire floor would likely plunge into silence. That would likely get the woman's attention. She unscrewed the suppressor on her pistol as she decided...it would be better to make more noise than try to bother hiding in the shadows. Putting the suppressor back onto her toolbelt, Cisila raised her Hammerhead Niner towards the sound system as she drew closer. As soon as she got close enough, she put her finger on the trigger. But as soon as she did so, someone grabbed her shoulder. Tightly. Cisila's first reaction was to slam her elbow backwards, and flipped the pistol around in her hand as she whipped around.

She pistol whipped the security guard behind her in the face, sending him toppling to the floor. Security had found her again and were forcing their way through the crowd. Cisila flipped her pistol back around into its proper grip and turned towards the sound system, pulling the trigger. The slide snapped back and the gun popped as the bullet fired, heading straight into one of the largest speakers. She controlled the recoil and fired the pistol more, aiming at each of the other speakers. Each fizzled out with a deafening *pop.* Everyone screamed. The woman on the throne, higher up, got up and approached the edge of the stage, looking down at the DJ's setup. Cisila raised her pistol into the air and fired again, causing everyone around her to run. The *bang* of the pistol filled the entire area, echoing off the walls. The casing of the bullet clattered to the floor. "HEY!" The woman screamed, down onto Cisila. "WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?!" She screeched. Cisila lowered the pistol and shoved it back into its holster, and looked up at the woman. Cisila felt a frown forming as she looked at the woman, who had a headband and an eyepatch on. A gorey scar scraped its way across her face, under the eyepatch. Cisila assumed the eyepatch was actually covering something gruesome. The woman's hair, while messy, was tied back into a tight ponytail. She had on a vest, jeans, and combat boots. Cisila pulled out the picture once more, and compared. The eyepatch had made it obvious enough, but it was definitely her. "HEY!" The woman screamed again, "I asked...what the FUCK is your problem?!" Cisila put the photo away and looked up at her, "I hate to interrupt-" She said, in a raised voice. "But I need to talk to you about something serious. If you could just-" But she was cut off. Cisila's expression quickly morphed into one of annoyance. "HELL no!" The woman screamed over her. "How did you even get *in?!* They're supposed to pat you down!" Cisila sighed. "You wouldn't have let us in if-" But she was cut off again. "I DON'T CARE." The woman screeched. "Is this about that fucking cult again? I told that piece of shit I have *nothing* to do with it." She put a foot on the railing, seeming to poise herself for a jump. Cisila watched her carefully, stepping back. "Hang on, what are you doing-" She asked. This woman seemed completely unhinged, but as she suddenly leaped into the air, using the railing as a springboard, Cisila slid back and raised her arms in a defensive block, watching the woman barrel straight towards her. Her fist raised into the air as she dove down at Cisila, and she screamed. "Get the FUCK OUT!" The woman's fist hit Cisila's forearms. An immense, overpowering force went through her nerves. The woman's punch was strong. Cisila immediately regretted going loud. She would have to fight this woman to get anything out of her- though, it likely would've ended like this either way.

Cisila forcefully pushed the woman away with her forearms during the brief time her feet were still off the floor. The woman tumbled to the floor before cartwheeling back onto her fight. "LIGHTS!" The woman screamed, clapping her hands. More lights strewn around the dance floor flickered on and started rapidly dancing between colours. The entire floor had soon become a confusing mess with blinking and flashing colours. Cisila felt herself lose control for a moment, the dazzling lights blinding her for a moment. The woman took her chance and dashed straight at Cisila while she was immobilized. With a crazed laugh, the woman slammed her foot into Cisila's chest and sent her barreling backwards. Cisila was barely able to catch herself and her shoes skidded across the dance floor, the soles heating up. Re-balancing herself, Cisila blocked the woman's next attack, a swift right hook. Deflecting it, Cisila punched the woman in the gut. "You're actually-" The woman spat, punching Cisila in the face, and sending her backwards once more. "- a decent fighter. What...the hell?" She hissed. Cisila, gasping from the pain, went from her unbalanced stance from the woman's punch into a heavy roundhouse kick, connecting directly with the woman's face. A horrible *crack* could be heard as Cisila's foot whipped against the woman's face, and then past her as she hit the dance floor. The woman grunted before pulling herself back up in a slick movement, pulling out a kitchen knife from her vest. "I told you to get out...why the fuck...WON'T YOU LISTEN?!" She screamed, sprinting full tilt at Cisila, swinging the knife wildly. Cisila was forced to dodge and duck around and under the woman's slices, unable to hit her. "I'm not leaving until I get answers!" Cisila hissed, determined to get *something* out of this insane woman. "WELL FUCK THE HELL OFF, WON'T YOU?! I'VE GOT *NOTHING* TO DO WITH THE CULT!" The woman screamed. To Cisila, as she continued to swiftly dodged around and under the woman's slices, it was obvious she did. Cisila hadn't even said a thing about the cult, and the woman had directly gone straight into violence. She knew something, and she didn't want to say. Kasey wouldn't like it, but it seemed like the only way to get anything out of this woman was to beat her half to death. Catching her knife in her hands as the woman brought it down on Cisila, she yanked it out of the woman's hands and threw it into the air, intending for it to go flying backwards. But it didn't. The knife went into the air above them, and unable to get to it, the woman threw a punch at Cisila. Going slightly off balance, Cisila punched back before catching another one of the woman's punches and kicking her away, sending both of them backwards. Sliding back across the stage, the knife was still in the air. If Cisila could catch it, she could stop the woman easily.
