#### SGT. CISILA J. SIVETA, 24

Twigs crunched under her boots as Cisila made her way through the tangled brush. Behind her, someone else followed. In the middle of the wilderness, she felt lost in the dark. But she and the squad she'd been assigned to had to remain in the dark as they creeped out towards an old warehouse. Her military gear weighed her down...and a band wrapped around her arm sapped her of any Ultima abilities. When she had first put it on, it felt like she had contracted a virus. But now...it felt more like a weight on her heart. The only thing she'd have left to stay alive during her military career would be her own hands. Under her boots, she felt more twigs crunch. They were as dry as a desert...and every single one was a noisemaker waiting to mess something up. She looked behind her, and could only barely see the silhouette of her squadmate, Ducain. They were the only two on this end of the warehouse, and the other four members of the squad were approaching from the north and west ends, respectively. They were heading in on the east end.

Suddenly, Cisila heard her radio crackle to life, the earpiece in her ear emitting static. she reached up to her radio and turned the tuner to the proper frequency. What come through was the squad leader, DELTA-LEADER, or just Kellien, as Cisila called her. ***"Four, Six. We're in position. Where are you?"*** Cisila sighed, then, holding down another button on the radio, she mumbled, "Almost there. Getting tangled in the trees." She pulled herself past a particularly sharp branch, and then behind her, she heard Ducain. "I think we're ready nonetheless. What's our goal again?" Sliding through bushes, Cisila carefully listened to DELTA-LEADER's next words. ***"Our goal is to neutralize the threat in the warehouse- it's going to be in close quarters, so remember to watch your fire. And don't, for fuck's sake, ever shoot any of the IEDs they've got in there."*** She heard cluttered responses from the rest of the squad. "Right," she added in. ***"Alright then, if we're all in position..."*** Cisila pushed aside frail bushes and finally saw the warehouse. ***"NVGs down. Safety off. Let's hit 'em hard."*** Cisila groaned and pulled down the heavy set of nightvision goggles drilled onto her helmet. With a quiet whirr and click, she was momentarily blinded by the pale green lights that let her see. After her eyes adjusted, she reached behind her and yanked her shotgun off her backpack. The hefty metal firearm was unwieldy, but it was the only kind of gun she'd bother to use in close-quarters. She couldn't handle assault rifles, and pistols didn't do enough to help her in this kind of situation. She dropped her left hand to her ammo pouches, and pulled out a shotgun round. She pulled back the charging handle on the shotgun and dropped the round in. The charging handle snapped forward. She now had an additional round in her shotgun- and she signalled to Ducain with her hand to move forward.

The two rushed through the remaining brush and quietly ran up to the side door they'd be entering. They had to wait until the lights switched off- Three and Five's doing. Positioning themselves near the door to remain unseen, they waited in silence. In her head, Cisila counted the seconds. It should only take a couple of minutes for the power to go out. And then...right on cue, the lights flickered out. Ducain looked to Cisila, nodded, and stepped in front of the door. Before he entered, he raised his hand to his radio and held down one of the buttons. "Going loud. You ready?" Cisila heard crackled acknowledgements from the other members. Ducain pulled a crowbar off of his backpack and jammed it between the door and the wall. Pulling aggressively, he used his strength to break the door open. With a *snap,* the door flew open. Cisila raised her shotgun and slid inside. Once inside, she moved down the hallway with her shotgun pointing down every empty room she could spot. Most doors were left open, as the former employees of the warehouse ran for their lives. Nothing jumped out at her- nobody shot her in the head. She signalled for Ducain to follow her to the next door into the main warehouse. "Entering the warehouse," Cisila muttered into the radio. She grabbed the rusty door handle, and cranked it downwards. 

Slowly pushing the door open, she scanned the warehouse. Rusting red, blue and grey shipping containers dominated the space, creating a large and confusing maze. Ducain walked up next to her. "Think they're hiding in there?" He motioned towards the shipping container maze. Cisila nodded. "Split up. Meet back here if you don't find anyone-" She paused. "If you do find someone, radio it. Then go find the captain." She was referring to the squad leader- Ducain jerked his head, which she assumed was a nod, and she set off towards a gap in the shipping containers. She held her shotgun up, bracing it against her shoulder. In the dark, with her night vision, the only thing she could see ahead of her were more shipping containers. More corners. Ducking around another corner, she heard something. *Footsteps,* her mind echoed. She immediately felt herself tense up as she approached where she thought the sound came from. One step after the other, she got closer. And then behind her, she heard a click. She instantly whipped around and saw someone trying to sneak up on her. She felt her surroundings slow down for a moment as her finger moved to the shotgun's trigger. When she pulled the trigger, she felt the shotgun fire, and its stock flew back into her shoulder. The loud *bang* that came from the firearm surely would have alerted anyone else- but she didn't care. She flung her shotgun back over her shoulder, which hung on for dear life on its strap, and pulled out a combat knife. If her shotgun didn't do enough damage, *she* would. She lunged towards the man on the ground, who was reeling in pain. The shotgun pellets had hit him all over, and even in night vision, she could see blood seeping through his outfit.

He wasn't armored, at least not to the extension that she and Delta squad were. Cisila flipped the knife around in her hand, grabbed the man's neck, and feeling herself flinch, she drove the knife into his head. Pulling the knife out, she wiped it off and shoved it back in its sheathe. "Who shot first?" Kellien suddenly interrupted, her voice over the radio barely coming through. Cisila shook her head for a second, exhaled, and held down a button on her radio. "Me. Anyone got anybody else?" She asked. "I got a couple idiots tryin' to hide in some lockers." Five said. "Took one down in the containers," Ducain added. "They definitely know we're here." Cisila pulled her shotgun back into her arms and continued to make her way through the maze. She would turn a corner, spot another similarly dressed target, and shoot him down. They seemed to be panicking- but she couldn't hold any remorse for them. They had stolen plans from the U.S Government. 

And usually, when you steal from the U.S Government, it isn't going to end good. She knew that perfectly well. Not only had they stolen the plans- they'd managed to kill anyone else coming for them. They had resorted to running to Congo, where they were now. Cisila thought they'd only been able to catch them like this because they thought they were safe. They weren't. They never would be again, so long as they were alive. She didn't envy that. Rounding another corner, she finally ended up back outside the shipping container maze. "I'm out of the containers," She said into her radio. "Moving to the next floor. Watch your fire." Muttered acknowledgements came through the radio as she moved towards the door to the stairwell. "Hang on-" Someone suddenly said from her left. Kellien had appeared out of nowhere. "They've armed that stairwell with a bunch of explosives." She said. She was sweating heavily- her unkempt black hair was going every which way. "How can you tell?" Cisila asked. Kellien paused, peering through the door's window. "I mean...just look." Cisila peeked through aswell. She could just barely see tripwires and small squares haphazardly fastened to the walls. Barrels were sitting on either side of the door, which probably meant that if she opened the door, she'd hit a tripwire. Cisila groaned, and stepped back. "Then where do we go?" She asked. Kellien laughed, "Really?" Cisila tilted her head, confused. "This isn't anybody's property anymore." Suddenly, Kellien smashed the window to the door open. She reached down to her vest and pulled a grenade off her ammo belt. "They won't be able to use it either after I'm done." Cisila reached forward to try and stop her- but she'd already pulled the pin on the grenade. "What the hell are you-" Cisila sputtered, but it was too late. Kellien lobbed the grenade through the broken window, and it clattered along the floor of the stairwell. 

Cisila yanked Kellien away by her shoulder, and tried to break into a sprint. Before she could even take a step, her eyes were filled with the sound of a massive, *massive* explosion. She could see light brighter than the sun shining around her as the stairwell was blown to smithereens and she was lifted off her feet by the force of the explosion. Her night vision goggles' vision was blown out by the massive amount of light that had suddenly appeared- she was blinded. She was slammed straight into what felt like a shipping container and she fell to the floor with a thud. It hurt, a *lot.* She gripped the goggles and lifted them off her eyes, trying to regain her sense of sight. She blinked heavily, and spotted Kellien a few feet away from her. Climbing back up onto her feet, Cisila stumbled. She wiped her forehead with her glove, and exhaled. "Kellien-" She croaked. Kellien slowly got up, shaking her head. "Fuck," she said between deep breaths. "At least they can't..." Kellien stretched, "...get up or down now." She cracked a smile. Turning towards the flames coming from the stairwell, Cisila could feel the burning embers from where she was standing. She realized something. "Kellien-" She started. Kellien looked at her, and her expression changed. She realized what she'd just done. Kellien's right hand immediately flew right to her radio, and she turned it on. "DELTA squad, I might have just lit a beacon for local militia to see us." She declared. "Oh, for fuck's sake, Kellien!" Five's voice said through the radio. *He sounds pissed,* Cisila thought. She stared into the fire, and realized...it was spreading. She walked over to Kellien and hit her shoulder, pointing towards the flames. "It's spreading. We need to leave. They'll die in here anyways." She knew at least one would survive, but there was no point trying to kill themselves to get one last man down. Kellien nodded, and she suddenly seemed more serious. She swore under her breath, "I didn't know there were *that* many explosives in there." 

Kellien grabbed Cisila's shoulder as she started to move. "Follow me." She broke into a sprint, and Cisila had no choice but to follow her. Ducking and weaving through the shipping containers, Kellien led Cisila back to one of the entrances. She bashed the door open and Cisila flew through it, stumbling along the concrete. "Is everybody out?" Kellien yelled into the radio. Every other squad member acknowledged, including Ducain. Cisila breathed a sigh of relief. "We need to get the hell out of dodge, *right now,* before the local militia gets here." Kellien continued, through gritted teeth. "Get your asses back the bivouac and we'll call for a rescue. Stay quiet, stay in the bushes, and don't let anyone see you. We're not supposed to be here." She sounded firm. And she was right, aswell- if they were seen, it would compromise the army's operations in the country. Not that Cisila cared, of course, but the word 'compromise' always meant 'you'll be executed for that' to her.

She yanked her night vision goggles back down over her face, and they flared to life. Kellien nodded at her, and Cisila took a step towards the forest again. As soon as her foot hit the concrete again, she was engulfed in a bright, white light. Her night vision goggles blew out the light so she was once again blinded.

She could hear helicopter blades above her. Kellien swore. 
They hadn't even moved, and they'd been caught.

She tugged the goggles back up and turned on the spot, looking around wildly. Then she looked up. A large dual-rotor helicopter was circling the warehouse, which was getting even worse. Her eyes follow the helicopter as it circled. Did it actually see them? Or was it surveying the damage? "Does *anyone* have something we can use to distract that idiot up there?" Kellien said. "I've got a couple flares." DELTA-TWO spoke. "But it would mean compromising myself. We can't do that." Cisila grabbed her radio, "We were literally standing in the chopper's searchlights and it didn't see us. I think we just need to run." She pulled out her pistol. "Hang on." Ducain suddenly said over the radio. "I have something."

How could Ducain have something? He was only carrying an SMG and a pistol- and some break-in tools, as far as she was aware. "Well, go for it. So long as it doesn't kill you." Kellien said. "But it better not draw more attention." Ducain made a kind of strange grunt as acknowledgement, and suddenly...the helicopter burst into flames. Cisila's eyes went wide. "What the f-" Her words were drowned out as the helicopter started imploding. What the absolute hell was it doing? It was making horrible crunching noises as metal bended into metal, in addition to the horrible screeching the rotors made as they collided into each other. "DUCAIN, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?" Kellien screamed over the crunching metal. Kellien bit back whatever else she was going to say, then yelled. "JUST RUN!" Cisila immediately broke into a sprint, and her gear felt heavy. She pulled her night vision goggles back down as the helicopter's light died and she entered the forest. She yanked her combat knife out of its sheathe on her vest and used it to cut through any branches or vines in her way. She didn't stop for at least 10 minutes, dragging herself through the flora.

Suddenly, it felt like the floor dropped out from under her. She had walked straight off a small ditch she couldn't see, and dropped straight into a shallow river. Pulling herself up, Cisila shook her head. "Ugh," She mumbled. Even with the NVGs, she couldn't see something hidden by the trees. The river rushed along, tugging at her feet. She flicked her radio on, and listened carefully. Nobody was talking. Reaching up to the dial, she slowly turned it to the next channel. And then the next. The dial clicked softly and she could her a soft crackle from the radio when the channel changed. When she turned it to the fourth option, she heard voices. Flicking another switch on her radio, the voices became clearer. "They got out." One man said. "Did you see where they went? They scattered. Who the hell were they?" Another man responded, "I don't know. They appeared from nowhere. I think they're from America." Cisila groaned. She waded through the water and climbed onto the other side of the river. She flicked her radio back to DELTA's channel and spoke. "Someone's using one of the open channels to communicate." As she made her way through the forest, back towards the bivouac location, she was met with silence. "Right," Kellien suddenly said. Cisila jumped a little. "I think we need to leave- fast. Six, what'd they sound like?" Cisila thought on that for a moment. They didn't sound like they were from Congo. They weren't American, either. If anything, she thought they sounded British. "Brits, maybe. Could be SAS." She muttered. "Oh, great." Kellien groaned. "Just what we needed." DELTA-TWO cut in, "We have to *leave,* then. Can we get on the truck and get evac?" Kellien sighed over the radio, "Yes. Get to the bivouac, and get the truck ready. Over and out." Cisila pulled out her compass and checked it. She thought she was in the right direction, so she said, "Ten-four, Kellien."

She continued through the forest, and came into a clearing. On the forest floor, she could see a burnt-out campfire. Tarps the same colors as the ground were propped up on rocks, acting as camouflage. She'd made it back. She sat down on a log and flicked her radio back to the channel she'd heard the maybe-Brits speaking on. As she flicked the dial, she could already hear the voices. "...'s a violation. I don't think they're supposed to make themselves known like that. What do we do?" One of the two said. The other mumbled something. "Eh?" The first inquired. "S'not our business, mate. I think we just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time." The second said, clearer. "Absolutely not," The first said. "We work with America, don't we? They fucked up, we gotta tell on 'em." The second man made some kind of grunt, which the first took as an agreement. "When we get back, we'll tell command what we saw." He said, simply.

Dejectedly, Cisila turned the radio off and sat there. Kellien could twist the story as much as she wanted to get them out of punishment, but if someone else had seen them, they had no chance of escaping whatever the government would throw them at next. Whatever was next, it would probably kill them. And that made her *mad.* She couldn't be in Chicago, defending the city. She had to be here, in the middle of fuck-all, doing dirty work for the worst government in human history. Suddenly, the leaves shifted. Out of the darkness, DELTA-FIVE appeared, followed by a tired TWO. Ducain forced his way out of the leaves and into the clearing, aswell. He sat down on the log, next to Cisila. DELTA-THREE showed up soon after, followed by Kellien. Everybody looked tired.

Kellien was the first to speak. "Ducain...what...the *hell* was that?" She asked. She sounded mad. Ducain was staring at the ground, holding his hands together. Kellien took a couple steps towards Ducain. "Hey. Ducain." He looked up, and sighed. "I didn't know it'd..." He fidgeted with his fingers, "...do that. It should've just taken it out." Kellien raised an eyebrow. "What? What did it?" Ducain looked up again, a bit surprised. "Uh-" He reached into his vest and pulled out something. He held it up. Cisila looked at it, confused. It looked like a large, thick lighter with engravings that made it look like it was from a fantasy movie. Ducain flicked the top open, and a bright flame emitted from it, blowing out Cisila's NVGs slightly. "It's...uh, it's...something I picked up. I haven't told anyone about it. It's not...normal." He spoke the word *normal* with a sort of tension. Kellien eyed it for a moment, and stepped away. "It's...whatever. The helicopter was the alarm, and the fire was the lever. It's my fault." The rest nodded. "Now," she sighed, "We need to get the hell outta here." She held up a finger and spun her hand, "Up. We need to go." Cisila got up from the log and strolled over to the truck hidden in the leaves. She pulled the hatch to the pickup bed down, and jumped onto it. Ducain, Five, and Three followed. Kellien struggled through the leaves, and climbed into the driver's seat. DELTA-TWO climbed into the passenger seat. Cisila tugged the hatch back up and locked it. She pulled her shotgun off of her backpack and set it on a miniature weapons rack bolted to the back of the truck. Instead of using the shotgun, she yanked a sniper rifle off the rack and checked to make sure it was loaded. She nodded at Ducain, who signalled to Kellien to start moving. The truck spurred to life, rumbling. Kellien drove it away, and out of the forest.

Once out on the desert, Cisila set herself up at the end of the truck, watching through the sniper scope. The sands along the road shifted as the truck passed, but otherwise, the only sounds she could hear were the truck itself. She couldn't see anyone following them. 

But one question trickled through her head. Who were those men? What were they doing?
