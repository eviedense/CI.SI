#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 24

Cisila slowly heaved open the side of the train's carriage, and the sliding door she grabbed onto creaked and ground loudly as she pulled it. As the door ran along its grooves, Cisila got a look inside the train car. Lyla was inside - tied to a chair with powerful, strong cables. *So, Dani wasn't kidding. They knew what they were talking about.* Cisila thought, as she slowly climbed into the train car. Cisila had found the train car at the far back of a large train yard just outside the main city. Dani's information was spot-on. "Lyla," Cisila whispered. "Lyla!" Lyla suddenly looked up, blinking. "Cisila? Oh my God..." She immediately looked relieved, "Fuck...finally." Cisila quickly made her way over to Lyla and attempted to untie her. *These things again...* They seemed to be the same kind of cables that Mikhail had used to tie Cisila up in the old school. *Which means they're probably Palmer property.* In her hand, her knife appeared, and she tried to saw through the cables with it. "No dice," Cisila said. Lyla shook her head, "No. I...uh..." She mumbled, "...Adam's got something to tell you." Cisila looked up at Lyla, "What? Here?" Lyla shook her head. "He said there'd be...something here, I'm not sure..." But before she could even attempt to explain, the lights in the train car suddenly flicked on, and the crackle of large speakers filled Cisila's ears. She quickly got up and looked around, her eyes scanning the entire car. In the dark, she hadn't been able to see anything. But now, she could see the messy wiring of the lights and the speakers haphazardly placed around the train's ceiling. "It was really nice of you to join us," Adam's voice said, crackled slightly from the speakers' poor quality. "I'm glad." *Asshat.* How could he still act like this? He'd nearly torn the city in two. If anything, in a couple more days, the entire place might go under because of the dozens of riots and the barbaric PALMER-EDEN security force. "Now, you see...we've got a problem, here." Adam continued, "If you don't hand yourself and your Ultima friends in by 5PM, at the PALMER-EDEN tower, we'll hunt you down to the ends of the Earth." Cisila looked around to see if there were any cameras to look at, and, in the mess of wires, she spotted one. Looking right at it, she said, "You won't. You don't have any jurisdiction." At least, she thought they did. If she could get out of the country...no. She wouldn't leave, not until Adam and Palmer were down for the count. "Not that it matters, because I'll *kill* you for what you've done to the city." Cisila stared directly into the camera. *I swear to God...*

Adam took a moment to respond, but when his voice hit the speakers again, Cisila felt her heart drop. "You see, the thing is...we captured your friend, uh..." He seemed to look over, "...what's their name- Dani." Her eyes went wide. How had they gotten their hands on Dani? Dani took *every* precaution to stay hidden, in the dark. "And if you don't get your asses over here before 5, they die. But hey, I guess fixing problems matters more than your friend here, right?" Adam was definitely able to see Cisila's face as she went through a mix of emotions. Anger. Fear. And then more anger. "You-" Cisila tried to say, but she was cut off by the speakers crackling and fading out. "FUCK!" She yelled. "HE CAN'T JUST..." Lyla kicked Cisila's leg, and spat, "HEY. Calm down. Get me out of this, and we can go get Dani." Cisila grumbled, turned around, and cut through the thick cables with her blade instead of her knife. The cables snapped apart as soon as they had enough of a cut in them. Lyla jumped up and dusted herself off, and Cisila asked, "Are you alright?" Lyla nodded, smiling, "I'll live. Dani's who we need to worry about right now." Cisila nodded, and pulled out her phone. She quickly called Kasey, who, like usual, picked up near instantly. "Kasey, Dani's screwed. I need your help." She said, quickly. "Can you get a hold of Zephyr? We probably need him. An- and can you make your way to the PALMER-EDEN tower?" It seemed like too much to ask for. Kasey responded, "He's gotten Dani? Fuck. Okay. I'll go find Zephyr- no worries." Cisila nodded, and then simply said, "Thanks. Stay safe." And she hung up. Nodding at Lyla, the two dropped down out of the train car, "What's the plan?" Lyla asked. Looking at the city's skyline ahead of them, where smoke constantly rose. The only building not clouded by the thick smoke of fire was the PALMER-EDEN tower. Cisila looked at Lyla, and declared, "We go straight for the tower. Anyone that gets in our way *dies.* I won't let him kill Dani." Lyla nodded, "That's a bit more like it." She remarked. And as if the world were clockworks, the sliding doors of other train cars in the yard slid open, and squads PALMER-EDEN security climbed out of them. "...Starting with them." She said. *They were waiting here. They're our first obstacle. Adam doesn't want us to get there.* But that wasn't going to stop her. Cisila twirled her blade in her hand as her EXO sprawled out along her body, creating a thin armor around her arms and legs. She held onto her blade with both hands, and prepared to *kill them all.*
