The luminous city of Chicago stood tall, and proud in the middle of the night. Neon lights shone down on the rain filled streets as cars drove through the city, going who knows where. Most apartments at this time had all their lights out, but some night owls still had their lights on. The rain pitter-pattered against the windows of one particular apartment, as one suddenly slid open. Someone climbed out of the window and shut it behind themselves, sliding a mask over their face. It clicked, and seemed to fasten to their face as they climbed up onto the edge of the fire escape, watching the street below. They suddenly leaped off of the edge of the fire escape and dove towards the street below. Before they hit the street, they flung their arm into the air and some kind of strange device formed around their arm- a grapple gun strapped to their arm. It fired, and latched onto a building across the street, and yanked them back up, giving them momentum and allowing them to go into a full swing. They cut the rope as it hit the apex of its swing, flinging themselves into the air. They backflipped through the air before plummeting back towards the street once more, and, despite cutting the cable to the grapple gun, they shot out another and immediately dove into another swing, following the street. After hitting the apex of the swing once more, they cut the rope again. Landing on the rooftop of an apartment building, they went into a roll and burst onto their feet, sprinting across the rooftop. They slid under and leaped over any obstacles in their path, determined to get wherever they were going.

And this mysterious person was just a girl. A girl named Cisila. Sliding to a stop at the edge of a rooftop, she kneeled down. *This is it.* She thought. Cisila carefully watched the bustling street below through her mask, waiting for a specific vehicle to pass by. She was watching for a large semi truck, hauling a large container. As she watched, the grapple gun on her arm seemed to grow, metal roots sprawling up her arm and across her body. Quickly, a whole exoskeleton had formed around her body, looking as though it was fused with her. Large parts forming joints connected with her actual, human joints. Wires spun around her arms and pieces of metal were wedged into her skin, stabbing through her thin jacket. It looked like it would be uncomfortable, but for Cisila, she couldn't feel anything. Under her strange, metal mask that looked as though it was welded together shoddily, her wine colored eyes flicked down to the furthest part of the street, and Cisila finally saw it. The semi truck. She sprang up and shook herself, trying to get any stress out. *Enough. Stop thinking about it- you'll be fine.* She sucked in some air, and then exhaled deeply. Her heart began to pound as the truck drew closer and closer; she could hear the rumbling engine. And as soon as it got close enough, her mind shut off. Her instincts took over- this was no time to worry. She leaped off the edge of the roofstop and plummeted towards the truck. The rain poured down on her hard as she hit the top of the container, denting it slightly. Pulling herself up, Cisila suddenly had a blade in her hand. It seemed to have come out of nowhere- folding together like a complex mechanical puzzle. It clicked, melding together, and she stabbed it into the roof of the container. Putting *all* of her strength into it, she tried to puncture the metal with the blade. Her muscles screamed in protest as she forced the blade down. All she needed was a sliver. *Anything.* 

Suddenly, the blade punctured through the metal with a strange metallic *pop,* and she yanked the blade out. It disappeared, seeming to fold away into her hand as she looked down at the tiny sliver. Cisila shook her head, and dejectedly slammed her fist against the puncture to make it open wider. Then again. *Slam.* The metal thunked with each hit, as the puncture widened. She stared down at the wider gap, and thought that it was good enough. She shoved a hand into one of her jackets' pockets, and pulled out an IED (improvised explosive device), and just as she was about to shove it through the gap, a thought crossed her mind. *Is this really a good idea?* It was the only tangible thought she'd had since landing on the truck, but it caused her to freeze. Everything seemed to slow down to an extreme, as she stared at the gap, and the IED in her hand. *This could go completely wrong.* But then, she knew the thing wouldn't explode until the semi reached its destination. PALMER-EDEN tower, right in the middle of the city. *Just put it in, and leave. Then you can-* Her train of thought quickly got cut off as the extremely recognizable sound of a pistol firing filled her ears, and a thin pistol bullet whizzed by her head. She gasped, swore, and rolled across the roof of the container. Cisila shoved the IED back into her jacket and sprang up, trying to see where the bullet came from- and immediately, another one flew by her. A sedan just next to the truck was the culprit- and it wasn't the only one. She'd completely forgotten that the truck had security. Quickly, her blade folded out in her hand again. And in the other, a small throwing knife. She dashed up to the end of the semi truck's container, and pitched the throwing knife straight at the man hanging out of the side of the sedan with a gun. The knife hit him square in the chest, and Cisila barely heard the dim yell of the man, over the engines. Suddenly, the truck sped up immensely. Stumbling, she realized- she'd been spotted. She ducked down and slid back down to the gap, pulling out the IED once more. Cisila didn't have time to think; she just shoved the IED through the gap, and heard it *thunk* against the floor of the container. Pulling herself back up, she was met with PALMER-EDEN security leaping off of apartment buildings and landing on the container. She'd done what she intended to, and now needed to leave. But the security detachment was in her way. She wasn't even sure how they'd known- but it wasn't going to stop her. 

Cisila rolled her shoulders back and twirled her blade. She didn't have to kill them...all she'd have to do was knock them off the container. She rushed forward, pushing against the wind and the rain, and raised her blade into the air. But Cisila had failed to realize something...something quite crucial, actually. And it was too late to defend herself. One of the men pulled out a pistol and shot her through the leg, and she stumbled- her blade fell out of her hands. *Shit-* Cisila didn't even have any time to react before another of the security detachment shot her aswell, and the bullet grazed her shoulder. Her exoskeleton couldn't do anything to defend her. Blinking, she felt the ringing of her ears as the pain registered. And then, out of nowhere, another man from the detachment rushed forward and tried to punch her off the container. *This* she could deal with. Grabbing hold of his arm, she snapped it in the wrong direction and slammed her fist through his gut, sending him back. But she couldn't do much more than that, because one final shot went through her own stomach. And that, she took as a sign to leave. She flung her left arm up, where her grapple gun was, and it fired, latching onto a tree of all things. She leaped off the truck and let the cable reel her in. She thunked against the tree her grapple had latched onto. Now, Cisila was dangling near the top of a tree. She loosened the cable and lowered herself to the roots of the tree, and the cable reeled itself back into the grapple. Looking around, she realized she'd found herself in the middle of a small park. *Fuck.* She thought, leaning back against the tree. She didn't have any help. Slowly, she pulled her mask off. It clicked and unfastened from her face, and she gently put it back into her jacket. What was revealed was her thin face- not quite gaunt, but she didn't look great. Freckles sprawled across her upper face, primarily down her nose and under her eyes. A pair of scars ran up the left side of her jaw, looking like sharp teeth. Her hair, a dark, dark brown, was a strange style, more messy than anything. She had some of it tied into a ponytail, but the rest of it fell down her shoulders and around her neck. A large swathe of hair covered her right face. *Two options.* She thought to herself. *Sit here...and bleed- or risk a hospital.* Now, it wasn't exactly appealing to her to bleed out in the middle of a park, so she pulled herself up. Putting a hand on her stomach, she felt blood. A *lot* of blood, and when she looked down at her leg, it was the same story. Her jackets' shoulder had gotten ripped from the bullet, and the skin underneath stung. If just three bullets was enough to make her run, she'd never have a chance against anything. 

Limping across the park, she felt dejected. Cisila had won, technically, but it didn't feel like it. Whenever this happened, it *never* felt like it. And just as she began to think to herself properly again, her leg gave out. She hit the pavement. She grunted, trying to pull herself up. But her leg wouldn't let her stand; she didn't have enough strength in her arms, either. Relenting, she let herself lie against the cold, wet pavement. Blood trailed down the side of her head, and Cisila realized she'd hit her head on the pavement. Her vision had gone slightly blurry as the ringing in her ears grew louder. She rolled over onto her back and stared up at the cloud filled sky. Rain pitter-pattered down onto her face, but she didn't bother to wipe it off. Cisila simply lay there, bleeding out slowly. Her blood mixed with the puddle she'd landed in, dying it a deep red. And just as soon as she'd decided to give up, someone appeared in her vision, standing over her. Someone familiar. Cisila sighed, as they spoke. "Not looking so good." And they knelt down next to her, pinching her cheek. "You still alive?" They said, smiling. She nodded, and mumbled, "Barely.", as the person looked over Cisila's injuries. It was her colleague (she didn't like to call her 'friend'), Dani. They were one of two who knew what Cisila did at night, as the vigilante, V. Dani had even given her that name. "How'd..." Cisila started to say, struggling to get any words out. "...How'd you find...me?" She asked, mumbling. "Oh, don't give me that." Dani said. "We've got eyes on you whenever you pull this kind of thing. Zephyr was watching you tonight. Came to me as soon as he could..." They explained, pulling out a tourniquet. Dani was talking about their organization- their- their *whatever it was,* Cisila remembered. Dani patched up Cisila over the next few minutes of silence, before they broke it. "Can you walk?" Cisila shook her head dejectedly. Now with a little more consciousness and without immense blood loss, she waas able to speak clearly: "Feels like it got lodged in a particular muscle." Dani rolled their eyes, "Great. Okay. I can fix that, it'll just take an hour or so. Hate doing it..." Doing what? Cisila looked at Dani, slightly alarmed. "Are you qualified to-" She tried to say, but Dani shushed her. "It's not anything a medical professional could ever do. Come on, you'll be fine." Dani pulled Cisila up and helped her get out of the park.

They were going to the Lighthouse. Cisila knew that.

The only place, aside from her apartment, where she felt safe.

Cisila gently sipped her tea. Her shoulder, leg, and stomach had been patched up. The bullets lodged in there had been removed. She wasn't sure how, as Dani had put her out cold before they bothered. Cisila wasn't going to bother thinking about what Dani did- all she was concerned with was her leg. It wouldn't let her get up, still, so she was stuck sitting in the Lighthouse. She put the teacup back down on its plate and leaned back in the old armchair she was sitting in, and her eyes scanned the circular interior of the first floor of the lighthouse. It was rather dim, and cluttered. Old furniture took up every corner, stacked up and useless. But a few pieces of furniture still sat freely, such as Cisila's chair and the table next to her. A small workbench was propped up against a wall, tools and parts strewn about its countertop. A dim kitchen inset on the other side of the floor sat quietly, its sink filled with still unwashed dishes. A few steps away from it, the spiral staircase that went up to the top of the lighthouse stood in the shadows. Cisila had only been up there a few times, and it was usually during the day. *Maybe I could head up there if I get up...* She thought, and she tried to move her leg a bit. Suddenly, she felt the life in it return. She pushed her foot down and bounced her leg, beginning to feel the pins and needles as if she'd been sitting on her leg for an hour. As she tried to get her leg to feel normal again, her phone buzzed. Pulling it out, Cisila saw that she had gotten a message- from Mikhail. Her ex. "Huh...?" She mumbled to herself. Why was Mikhail messaging her? They didn't really talk to each other anymore, but it wasn't because of anything bad. Cisila had just realized that they didn't work. Something felt off to her. But that was neither here nor there, so she opened up the message and read it. *"Sorry for random message at this time. How are you?"* Mikhail had typed. Her eyes scanned the message, *Little weird...* but she thought no more of it, and responded. *"Doing good. Little tired from tonight, but it's nothing to worry about."* Before she tapped the send button, she added on, *"Why the sudden message?"* to the end of her own. Pushing send, she put her phone down again and looked down at her leg. The feeling of pins and needles were slowly fading away, and she could feel her leg again. Cisila rubbed her eyes and slowly got up, shoving her phone into her cargo pants' pocket. 

She walked slowly over to the stairs and put her foot onto the first step. Climbing up the stairs slowly, the metal steps creaked underneath her. One step after the other, she went higher and higher, around and around, before getting to the top. The giant light and its controls stood dormant in the lantern room, but she just ignored them. Turning the handle on the door to the gallery deck, she stepped outside. The cold air of the night hit her immediately, and Cisila noticed that it had stopped raining. In fact, pretty quickly, the clouds had cleared. The moon was reflecting light brightly. The lighthouse was situated a fair bit away from Chicago, and from here, Cisila could see Lake Michigan in all its glory, and, if she took a few steps to the left, she could see Chicago. Quietly staring at the Lake, she sighed. Dejectedly, she pulled out her phone again. It was almost two in the morning- she'd either have to leave soon, or forget going to work tomorrow. *And not going to work tomorrow means...* Cisila's brain started to say to her, but she shut the thought down. A small piece of anxiety bubbled in her stomach as her brain forcefully reminded her. And then when she realized she'd have to get up in the morning...Cisila felt extremely tired, out of nowhere. *Two in the morning.* She reminded herself. Dejectedly, she pulled a lighter out of her back pocket and followed up by pulling a small pack of cigarettes out of one her cargo pants' lower pockets. Opening it, she saw there was only one cig left. She stared at it, and her brain quickly flew through whether or not she should take it. *Take it. Don't take it. Take it. Don't take it.* It was like fighting a losing battle uphill. Relenting, she raised the pack to her mouth and bit down lightly on the end of the last cigarette, before withdrawing the pack. Cisila raised the lighter to the tip of the cig, and flicked the spark wheel. *Flick.* One firm spark caused a flame to burst out, and she lit the cigarette, hiding the flame with her free hand. As she quietly stood there smoking, her phone buzzed again. Pulling it out, she saw that Mikhail had replied. She blinked slightly at how bright her phone was (*Should turn that down...*), before reading Mikhail's new message. *"Don't mean to scare you, but it doesn't look like you're home. You OK?"* Cisila's brow furrowed as she read this. *What the hell?* She drew her phone closer to her face, *I'm not hallucinating, right?* Scanning the message again, she used her free hand to pull the cig out of her mouth again, letting out a cloud of smoke. Quickly, she texted Mikhail back. *"Are you AT my apartment? Why are you there?"* And she tapped send. Almost immediately, Mikhail started to type- as indicated by the three bubbles. *"Yeah. I wanted to check up on you. Sorry."* 

Silently, she texted back. *"It's fine. I'm out right now. Check on me tmrw. Will be rlly tired, tho."* Mikhail indicated that he'd seen the message with a thumbs up, and Cisila assumed that was that. Putting her phone away, she continued to smoke while staring out at Lake Michigan. It didn't feel like she had the willpower to go to work at the bookstore anymore. She was just some employee there, nothing special, but ever since her mom died- she'd been terrified to do any kind of job. *The sound of that gun still rings in my ears.* Cisila thought. *I still remember the feeling of her blood. All over me.* As she stared out over the calm waters, the images of her mother's death flashed through her head. *Three men. All in suits.* That was the only lead she'd had, and it was why she had wound up in Chicago. Not because her mother lived there, but because those three men...she remembered their faces clearly. Except for the one in the back- the one that didn't shoot. But the other two, they had remained clear in her head. They were the commanders of two syndicates in Chicago. Large organized crime operations. And then, she'd found that they were working with the company her mother had worked for. PALMER-EDEN. The same one that, an hour ago, she'd tried to sabotage. Ever since she got to Chicago, she'd been trying to find out what PALMER-EDEN had done to not just her mother, but herself. A month before her mother died, she'd told Cisila that her workplace had chosen her daughter for some kind of experiment- and there was no way Cisila was going to get out of it. She remembered her mother's face clearly. She was horrified. And what they'd done to Cisila...she lifted her free hand up to the right side of her face, which was covered by a large swathe of hair. She'd grown it out ever since the experiment, combing it so it would always cover her right eye. PALMER-EDEN had done something to her. Given her something she didn't even know existed. *Superhuman abilities.* Cisila flicked the hair out of her eye for a moment, revealing that her right eye looked...strange. Wires stuck out around her eye, as if she were some kind of cyborg. The eye itself remained mostly normal, aside from the iris being a darker shade of wine compared to her left eye, aswell as her pupil being a different, unnatural shape. But it was enough that people noticed. Whenever she'd head into town, she'd get weird looks unless she wore sunglasses. So, Cisila decided to grow it out. And now she looked like this. And now, in Chicago, she had one goal. Avenge her mother, or die in the process. It was all PALMER-EDEN's fault.

After a few more minutes of silence, she snuffed out the cigarette on an empty ashtray sitting against a window sill. She inhaled slowly, and exhaled. Shutting her eyes, Cisila decided she was going to go to work. *No reason not to. Nothing to be scared about. Why even get scared about work when you do much riskier things?* That was always what she told herself, but no matter what, it didn't seem to work. But it didn't matter. As she made her way back down the lighthouse, she continued trying to shut her brain off. Stepping out of the lighthouse and locking it behind her with Dani's spare key, she walked her way down the dirth path to a small garage. The land around her was completely dark, and the only lights were along the asphalt street a few hundred metres down the dirt road. Heading up to the dirt garage, she pulled the garage door open and stepped in, turning on the lights. Inside the garage, Cisila's motorcycle sat silently. *Knew they'd bring it here.* Whenever Cisila got badly injured enough to get taken to the Lighthouse (it happened frequently), Dani would pick up Cisila's motorcycle and leave it in the garage. Lying on the seat was Cisila's satchel, and her helmet. She strode over to it and pulled the helmet on slowly, and pulled her satchel over her shoulder. *They're smart enough to bring my stuff, too. Thank God for Dani.* Cisila thought, as she swung a leg over her motorcycle. Climbing on, she turned the key to get the bike's engine going. It flared to life beneath her, and its singular light flooded the area in front of her. She drove her heel against the kickstand, and revved the motorcycle. *Alright. Time to get outta here.* And as she rolled the motorcycle out of the garage, feeling it rumble beneath her, all her worries faded away- if even just for a moment. Cisila sped up, and she drove along the dirt road, heading for the highway. Back home. For now.

#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 24

Cisila woke up lying face-down on her bed. It didn't feel like she got any sleep. Then again, she never did. Slowly, Cisila pulled herself up and shook her head. Her phone, on her bedside table, was beeping. Her alarm for the day. Groggily, she slid over to it and turned it off. And before long, she'd gotten dressed, combed her hair, and brushed her teeth. Standard protocol. Stepping out of the bathroom, she looked around her apartment. It was small (of course it was), and cluttered. Laundry she'd been meaning to do was sitting next to the couch, that which was pushed against the wall. The solitary window (the same that Cisila would use to leave out at night) let the early morning sun in, brightly. No lights were on, inside the apartment- but near the window, a small table sat. An antique lamp sat on it, surrounded by picture frames. And inside the frames, various old photos of Cisila and her family could be seen. They were worn. But the smiling faces of her father and mother, and even a younger Cisila, always shone through. Unwashed dishes sat in the kitchen sink, even though Cisila had told herself to do them. Now was obviously not the time either. As Cisila carefully stepped towards the door, she checked herself. She had everything she needed, and her outfit seemed fine. Her usual purple t-shirt and light grey cargo pants, along with a strange navy blue leather wrap around her right hand. She also had a smartwatch around her left wrist. She pulled her satchel off of her coat rack, and over her shoulder. She pulled on her shoes. Rubbing her eyes, Cisila pulled out her favourite earbuds and put them in. *Off we go.* And she stepped out into the hallway. The complex's hallways all looked the same. Beige. Lots of beige. Cisila stood out like a thorn in the blank, beige hallway. She looked down the hallway, and headed towards the stairwell. Swiftly walking down the stairs, she walked out into the lobby, and towards the exit. Pushing the two doors open, she stepped out onto the sidewalk. Unlike a few hours previously, the sky was clear and blue. It was September, almost October. Leaves were turning orange, yellow and red. 

Cisila pulled her phone out and turned on some music as she headed for the subway. She slid between groups of people on the street quietly, letting her music drown out all the voices around her. There was a surprising amount of people out, for how early it was. She watched the people walking past her, when she spotted someone strange looking ahead of her. *That's a strangely fancy suit...* She thought. The man she'd seen, just ahead of her, was wearing an extremely expensive looking red suit, in addition to polished black shoes. *What kind of guy wanders around in that?* She thought, thinking to speed up to get past him. As soon as Cisila tried this, however, someone grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back. *Huh?* She looked back, only to see the grizzled face of an older man. "Are you tryna get close to the boss?" He spat. Cisila's brow furrowed, and she replied, "Wha-" but she wasn't able to finish her sentence, as the man shoved her into an alleyway. *Oh, fuck.* She realized, and shook her head. *Did I just accidentally mess with some syndicate members?* And her thought was confirmed as soon as the man walked into the alleyway, making Cisila back up. He was followed by two more grunts, "The boss don't like gettin' followed." The man grumbled. If Cisila knew her stuff, there was no reason to argue. There was only one thing she could do. "And frankly," The man continued, "Been waitin' to get my hands on someone to get my stress out." Her lip twitched. *Gross.* Cisila thought. "Right. Okay." She said. "And how am I supposed to do that?" The man tilted his head, "Well...usually, I don't like hittin' women," Cisila frowned, "but you've got a punchable face." And as soon as he finished his sentence, he shook his wrists out before clenching his fingers into fists. Cisila shook her head, and raised her fists aswell. "I'm not a punching bag." She said. The other two members scoffed, and stepped forward. Cisila noticed one of them was female. They pulled out blunt weapons. *I can't kill them.* She remembered. *I can't use my EXO. It's just me, and my fists.* And then she remembered she was supposed to be going to work, and pursed her lips. *It's fine. It's fine. I'm sure someone'll understand.* She thought. Cisila made sure her feet were planted to the ground, and stared right at the one who'd grabbed her. "Alright, enough fuckin' standing around!" The leader of the three yelled, and lunged towards Cisila.

<sup><sub>Note: Cue Soul of the Ogre (or Un altro appassionato) from LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN</sub></sup>

Swiftly, she ducked out of the way of the man's punch, and elbowed him in the face. He grunted, stumbling back. She'd hit him square in the nose. While he was disoriented for a few brief milliseconds, Cisila took her chance. She flung her left arm towards the man's face, hitting him square in the jaw with a left hook. Immediately, she followed up with a right hook followed by another left before leaping into the air and twisting herself around to roundhouse kick him in the face. The man collapsed, but managed to pull himself back up before Cisila could do something. "Goddamn...it." He spat, pulling out a pocket knife. Cisila flinched. Like a wild animal, the man leaped forward once again, swinging the knife wildly in Cisila's direction. She dodged this way and that, ducking underneath his swings or barely getting out of the way. The man continued to push forward, forcing Cisila further into the alleyway- and closer to its dead end. She continued to dodge around his knife swings, and tried to catch his arm. "Quick like a rat, aren't you-" He grunted, yanking his arm out of her grip and swiftly slashing at her face. Cisila couldn't get out of the way in time- the knife slashed down her forehead and cut through one of her eyebrows- leaving a surprisingly deep injury. She swore, and knocked the guy away. *That's it.* Feeling a sudden rush of adrenaline through all of her muscles, she changed tactics. She punched the man in the gut, once, followed by a series of blows to his chest. Pausing for a moment, she followed up with a heavy uppercut against his jaw. As her knuckles met the man's jaw, something broke. And whatever that was, it was enough to stop the man from getting up again. He hit the floor hard, and was out cold. However, she didn't have time to recover, as the two other gang members stepped forward, twirling their blunt weapons. Cisila had had enough. Walking forward, she yanked the lid off of a metal trash can and used it as a shield. The first of the two men tried desperately to get around Cisila's defense, but she refused to let go of the lid. He slammed his baton against the lid, creating a loud *thunking* sound. When he stopped for a moment, Cisila took her chance. She slammed the metal lid down onto the gang member's head, before gripping the edges of it and slamming it against his face a couple more times. Throwing it away, she grabbed onto the member before he had a chance to collapse, and thrusted him against the wall, and as he slid down it, she slammed her knee against the back of his head, pushing his face against the wall. 

Cisila turned her attention back towards the last one, when she noticed that she must have bolted. Collapsing next to the gang member she'd just taken out, she touched the injury above her eye. It had cut deep enough that it stung. Blood was dripping down her face. Quietly, she groaned to herself. *"Fuck."* Going to work like this was a bad idea, but she'd already told herself to go. Dejected, she pulled out some bandages from her satchel. There was always at least a couple bandages in there- she always needed them. Pulling out a towel, she carefully tried to clean the injury. Not being able to see it wasn't exactly a big help, but when she thought she'd cleaned it sufficiently, She plastered a bandage over it. Cisila pulled herself up and realized she probably looked even worse than she already did. As she walked out of the alleyway, she felt as though she didn't achieve anything. Random brawls *never* achieved anything. But there was something strange about that one- why had they stopped her from getting close to that man in the red suit? Then Cisila remembered that...everybody was giving the man a rather wide berth. It appeared that, out of everyone, only Cisila had no idea. As she fell into thought, she automatically followed her daily route. Before long, she was on the subway. As she stepped onto the subway car, she noticed how full it was. *What is happening today?* Cisila thought to herself, looking around at all the people. Most of them looked even more tired than she did- as if they'd woken up earlier than usual. Some looked as though they didn't even get *any* sleep. Looking up at the small LED screens lining the top of the subway car, she noticed why. The news. She squinted at it, trying to read the headlines on the tiny screen. The first headline she managed to read was *PALMER-EDEN transportation truck exploded in middle of freeway.* Cisila stared, despondent. Her eyes, wide, were locked onto the screen now. *What does that mean? That's- that's not what I meant to do.* The truck was supposed to head back to the depot, and the IED should've detected that, and detonated. It wasn't supposed to blow up on the motherfucking *freeway!* The footage the news provided was clearly from a helicopter, overlooking the scene. The time in the top left read *1:30AM*. It was showing the aftermath. A large chunk of the freeway had been blasted to bits. Cars and other trucks were flipped. Burning. The semi-truck that she'd planted the IED in was in pieces, having erupted into flames. The blast radius wasn't right. None of this was right. How had it detonated? Why? 

She lowered her eyes from the screen, when the news presenter seemed to say something. Cisila couldn't be bothered to take her earbuds out, but she heard one thing over her music. *"...Confirmed that, about an hour prior...mysterious assailant..."* Her lip twitched, and she immediately whipped her head back up to look at it. The footage had changed: the time in the top left corner now read *12:45AM*, and Cisila felt a sinking feeling in her stomach. Someone had recorded her. She watched the footage silently, seeing her own actions play back in her face. The recorder had only caught one thing- Cisila getting the IED in. But it felt bad nonetheless. Pulling out one of her earbuds, she carefully listened to the news presenter's report on this. "We reached out to PALMER-EDEN Pharmaceutical for comment, and their response was quite intriguing, and in fact, may shed some light on why this happened in the first place." Cisila sighed, *Of course. They have a way with words...* and then she listened to the presenter read out their response. "Early this morning, one of our trucks was attacked." *I didn't intend to get violent. My plan wasn't to blow it up in the middle of the freeway...* Cisila gripped the metal pole she was holding onto for support. "And we do not condone the actions of whoever has done this. The supplies in there were, most unfortunately, essential to our advanced vaccine development." *No they were not!* She ground her teeth against each other, staring at the screen still. "The criminal who did this likely sabotaged our vaccine development for one simple reason- they despise development." That wasn't it. They weren't even close. PALMER-EDEN had ripped her normal life away with their secret experiments and projects, and she was determined to not just stop it, but expose it. For her mother. And it felt like every step she took forward- PALMER-EDEN pushed her back several more. That truck was filled with experimental technology meant to make more people like her. At least, she was certain it was. She'd kept notes on every single piece of cargo leaving the Chicago tower- and that truck was on the very same schedule that contained the tech to create more superhumans. She was *sure* she'd gotten the right one. But that still didn't detract from the fact that the IED she'd made detonated on the freeway. That *wasn't* supposed to happen, and now, she felt guilty. 

Whatever the rest of PALMER-EDEN's response was, she didn't get to hear it. The subway slowed down and the doors opened at the next stop. Her stop. She let go of the pole and walked out of the subway car, and onto the underground platform. Cisila walked up the steps and back out into the clear day, and for a moment, she forgot about the news report. The bookstore she worked at was just down the street, and she could already see it. A small pang of stress violated her brain for a moment before she pushed it away and headed towards the bookstore. The outside was pleasant: a simple storefront with two large window panes with new books sitting on shelves, with signs showing their prices. Other books were on sale. As she approached the front doors, she pushed them open. They were old wooden doors, dyed a nice purple-red. Stepping in, the smell of books hit her. She inhaled through her nose, letting the paper smell fill her nostrils. *That's better.* Cisila walked over to the counter, behind it, and stepped into the back rooms. She changed into her work outfit: a simple long-sleeve shirt with a nametag clipped to the breast pocket of the shirt. The shirt itself was mainly a white color, with red accents. She fluffed out her hair, making sure it looked good *enough*, and sat down on the couch in the employee break room. Her satchel was next to her. Cisila stretched, feeling her spine crackle. *Eeesh.* She'd slept like a rock, but it didn't exactly feel great getting up. Her muscles still hurt, aswell as her back. As she stretched, someone walked into the employee room. And it caused Cisila to freak out- immediately. "Hey! You're here...jeez-" They said, sitting down next to her. *Lyla.* Her inner voice echoed. Cisila's lips were sealed shut. Lyla leaned over and looked at Cisila, "...You don't look so good. You, uh..." Lyla tried to find the words for a second, "...you get into a fight or something? That bandage isn't really helping." This snapped Cisila out of her stress trance, "What? It isn't?" She asked suddenly. "No, it...really needs some taking care of. Jeez." Lyla put a hand on Cisila's shoulder and got even closer. Cisila shivered. "Huh? Oh- sorry." Lyla let go. "I'm just trying to get a good look at it." Cisila nodded, and said, "I did...get into a fight. Didn't mean to." Lyla scoffed, and smiled. Cisila tried not to look.

"Well, I can help out with this, but...not right now. I don't think it's a good idea for you to work looking like this. You've still got some dried blood on your face." Cisila's eyebrows furrowed, and she looked worried. "Really? Ah, shit...I..." She leaned back, but Lyla reassured her, "It's fine. You don't look like you killed someone, at least." Cisila nodded, and responded, "That's good at least. If- if I can get cleaned up, I still want to work. I told myself I had to." and she slowly got up. Lyla got up aswell, "You sure? You look dead tired, Cisila." she pointed out. That was true, yes, but Cisila was determined to work. "I'm good. I'm fine." She waved Lyla away, "I'll...I'll go to the washroom and clean up." Lyla clicked her tongue. "If you say so. Come to talk to me later." And Cisila nodded, heading to the bathroom.

<sup><sub>Note: Cue in jeopardy from JUDGMENT/JUDGE EYES</sub></sup>

As Cisila stepped out of the bookstore, her shift being over, her phone rang. A call. She pulled her phone out of her pocket and looked at the caller. It was one of her few actual friends, Kasey. She answered the call and held her phone up to the side of her head, "Yo?" Cisila said. "I've got something to show you, Cisi." Kasey said, sounding rather tired. More tired than Cisila, maybe. "What's up?" She asked. Kasey took a good moment to respond, "Uh...well," Cisila could hear the sifting of papers, "I found something you might want to look into." Kasey finally said. Kasey was a detective, and, unlike most claiming to be a detective, actually had her own business. She didn't get many jobs under that business, but whatever she did get, it was enough to keep her afloat. "Alright. Should I head over?" Cisila asked, looking around the block. "Yeah, that'd be nice." Kasey responded. Cisila started heading down the sidewalk, heading for the building where Kasey lived- and also where her detective business was located. "Can you...maybe explain this a bit, though?" Cisila asked. "Kind of improptu." She added. "Yeah, sorry," Kasey said, "It's something that might concern you- and I'm kinda worried someone might end up pinning it on you-" She paused, "...that is to say, V, sorry." She added. Kasey was the only one who knew, other than Dani, what Cisila did at night. "Right." Cisila said. "Who's it concern?" Kasey sharply inhaled over the phone, "So, you know how you asked me to locate all three leaders of the syndicates in the city?" She explained. "I found them. And one of them definitely matches your description." Cisila felt her stomach rise. "Really?" She said. "Y- Yeah." Kasey mumbled, "Thing is...it seems like he was murdered. A couple hours ago." Cisila's face fell. She picked up her pace down the sidewalk, "Why?" she asked, trying to sort this out in her head. "Why do you think I'm telling you?! You're the only one who was looking for him. Someone must have caught onto that somehow." Kasey said. "That's a bit of a stretch." Cisila said through gritted teeth, "It could just be a coincidence. And if it is, *fuck."* she spat that last word out with a malicious tone. "Where's the body?" Kasey took a moment to respond. "Pretty close to your apartment. I was going to ask you to go take a look. I can send the address." She said. *Gah.* Cisila thought. *That man was my only lead on why my mother was killed- forget the other two, he shot first. And one of them didn't even shoot.* She believed that PALMER-EDEN had hired the syndicates to murder her mother in cold blood. The question was why. What had her mother done? Why bother with organized crime at all? "I'll go now." Cisila relented, slowing down. She turned a corner and headed for the subway. "This is bad." She mumbled. "No kidding..." Kasey said. "Keep me updated. Get pictures. Y'know the drill at this point, right?" Cisila sighed, "Yeah. No problem." She ducked down into the subway, hung up on Kasey, rushed down the steps and waited for a train to arrive.

Her mind was racing at the possibilities. Someone had murdered a rather important underworld figure. It was entirely possible this was just some kind of dispute. But it was also possible that it could've been because she was looking for him. *Either of these are possible. Or it could be something completely different.* She couldn't shake the feeling that it was because she was looking for the man- her memory of his face was as clear as day. Cisila knew she'd seen it again in Chicago. She could've gotten to him, and forced the information out of him. But if he was dead, her chance was gone. It would be back to square one unless she could figure out why he was murdered. And if it was connected to her, then it might have been PALMER-EDEN. She knew their track record, and she thought they were tying up loose ends. A clean murder staged to look like a gang shootout was her first thought as she boarded the train. It felt as though the ride took *ages,* but in reality, it was only a few minutes. Cisila stepped off the train and rushed back up the steps and out of the subway. *Almost there.* She thought, now almost sprinting down the sidewalk past her apartment. She whipped out her phone again and checked Kasey's message, making her way to the address. Cisila slid to a stop at the address, looking up at the building. It was another apartment complex. The interior lobby looked fine, but then her eyes flicked over to an alleyway between the apartments and another building. Cautiously, she took a step towards the alleyway, and peeked in. It was a surprisingly wide alleyway, filled with trash cans, dumpsters, and trash bags. Police tape had been put up at the entrance. But at the end...Cisila squinted. In the shadows, it looked as though there was a body slumped against the wall. And a *lot* of blood. Far too much. *...That doesn't look like it was a fight.* Had PALMER-EDEN given up on being sly? She stepped into the alleyway slowly, ducking under the police tape, and taking careful steps towards the body. And as she got closer, and closer...it stopped looking like PALMER-EDEN's work. It stopped looking like a gang fight. The body looked as though it was torn apart. 

It looked as though it had been torn apart by a rabid animal. Limbs were missing. The chest looked as though it had burst- organs were missing. There was a horrible smell as she got closer, which made her take out her metal mask, and pushed it onto her face. She also pulled out a pair of gloves and put them on, aswell as rummaging through her bag for a flashlight. Pulling her flashlight out, she knelt down in front of the body and turned on the flashlight. *God, what the fuck?* Her brow furrowed as she stared into the giant cavity the stretched from the man's chest to his abdomen. Blood poured out like a waterfall, still. A bunch of his organs were missing. Cisila turned the flashlight up to the man's face. And it hit her. It *was* him. The same beard- the same olive skin. The same buzzcut. She ground her teeth against each other as she tired at the lifeless face. Fear was embedded in his eyes. Whoever, or *whatever* had killed him had struck some kind of fear into him. *Now the question is...what does he do as a syndicate leader? Which one does he even lead?* She reached for the man's pockets, carefully feeling them. *A wallet. A phone, too.* Cisila pulled them out slowly, carefully. Obviously, being a rather wealthy man because of organized crime, his phone was top of the line. *But it probably doesn't have anything on it.* Nobody in their right mind would use their personal phone to store evidence of their crimes. And his wallet...it probably didn't have anything either, but just to be sure, she sifted through it. His debit card was gone. Any money that may have been in the wallet was gone aswell...or it was never there to begin with. Coupons and receipts seemed to be the only thing left in the wallet. *Fuck...* She thought, beginning to feel frustrated. Cisila put them into her bag, but thought, *Useless.*, which felt obvious to her already. Getting up, she turned to leave. But just as she got up, Cisila heard someone scream at her. She whipped around, only to be met by a woman in a suit, who looked like she meant business- and judging by the small pin on her suit, she was with a syndicate. Bad news. "It was YOU!" She screamed. *Shit.* Cisila thought, looking around. *I can't be caught like this- shit.* Her mask was on, which meant that her identity was technically safe. But that didn't mean this wasn't a gigantic risk. Cisila felt a twinge of anger. "Get the HELL out of here, you piece of-" Before the woman could even finished her sentence, a small throwing knife constructed itself in Cisila's hand, and she pitched it straight towards the woman. It went straight into her head. And she fell to the ground. Cisila didn't think anything of it for a moment, as she took a step forward. But then, more syndicate members rushed into the alleyway before she could even do anything. She stopped dead cold. There was half a dozen. More than she could handle- without killing them, at least. "Knew the murderer would return to the scene..." One of them said, twirling a metal bat in their hands, "Always happens. We were waitin'." Two more pulled out pistols, while the rest brandished small knives or batons. 

<sup><sub>Note: Cue Fog from LOST JUDGMENT</sub></sup>

Cisila ground her teeth, and flung her right arm out, with her hand splayed. She wasn't going to hold back if they were trying to kill her. In her hand, her blade began to fold out, clicking and whirring. It put itself together like a mechanical puzzle as she grabbed hold of its hilt. "Alright." She said, "I didn't kill him. I'm just here to look. But I don't think I can change your mind..." Cisila twirled the blade and grabbed hold of it with both her hands, readying herself in a defensive stance. This was her element. She could fight her fists, but she meant business with a blade. And those guns weren't going to stop her. *Not like last night.* "Tch," One of them spat, "Your superpowers don't scare us!" they yelled, as they raised their pistol and pulled the trigger. It felt as if everything slowed down to a crawl as the bullet left the barrel, going straight for Cisila. She watched it get closer and closer, before she sprang into action. In complete slow motion, she took a running start. She flung her arms up in the air, keeping a tight hold on her blade, and brought it straight down onto the bullet. As soon as the metal of the blade collided with the tiny nine millimetre bullet, sparks flew. The bullet went off course as Cisila continued to bring her blade down, shoving her heels into the ground and sliding to a stop. Time sped back up to a normal rate as Cisila was forced to dodged around all the syndicate members' attacks. She went this way and that, wildly swinging her blade as she whirled around. Cisila flipped her blade around so she was holding it backhanded, turned towards the nearest syndicate member, and thrust the tip of the blade into their upper chest. She shoved it deeper, grabbing hold of the hilt with both hands. Then, in a counter-clockwise arc, she tore through the member's upper chest, and head with the blade. His head split in two, his chest split apart as she ripped the blade out of him. *It's self defense.* She told herself. *They're trying to kill me.* Cisila deflected another of their attacks and roundhouse kicked them into the wall, knocking them out. *Better.* But as she continued to deflect and counter the rest of their attacks, each of them fell. They had all been stabbed by her. They weren't dead, but they were going to die if nobody saved them. Cisila knocked down the last one and stomped on their head, breaking their nose. And then she stumbled back, catching her breath. Her blade disappeared into her hand, and she suddenly became laser focused on the police sirens she could hear in the distance. As if it was a natural response, her EXO sprawled out around her arms and legs, and her grapple gun formed on her left arm. She flung her arm up and fired the grapple. It pulled her up to the rooftop, where she pulled herself up and collapsed. *Made the scene of the crime even worse. And I didn't even get anything...* Then she realized she still had the man's phone. And in the wallet...there had to be some form of I.D in it, she knew she saw something. Cisila could bring those to Kasey. She sighed, relieved. There *was* something. Pulling herself up, she decided to just parkour her way back to Kasey's. She was kind of a mess again (blood had gotten on her clothes- not a good look), and didn't feel like going home just yet. So she stretched briefly, before breaking into a sprint. Leaping over rooftops, sliding under and over pipes sticking out of the roofs, Cisila ran to Kasey's.

She climbed in through a window, and, having notified Kasey, was able to get in easily. Kasey was sitting at a cluttered desk with her legs resting on it, smoking a cigarette. Kasey herself looked like a mess. Her messy hair  was tied into a ponytail, which really didn't do much- similar to Cisila's- and most of her hair fell around the sides of her head and shoulders. A pair of sunglasses was stuck in her hair, looking rather useless. She was wearing a white t-shirt and a maroon vest, with fingerless gloves on her hands. "Jeez..." Kasey said, looking at Cisila. "Oh- uh-" Cisila stammered, "Got into a fight. Syndicate trying to kill me." Kasey pursed her lips, looking Cisila up and down, "...Well, don't get any blood on my floor. Otherwise, I couldn't care less!" She threw her hands out, "Seriously. I've got a gun on me for a reason. I don't give a shit if you kill someone. That's kind of your job, isn't it?" Cisila's brow furrowed, and she pulled off her mask. "...It's more like a job that Dani makes me do. I couldn't care less about the criminals in this stupid city, unless they're the Syndicate." She explained. Kasey scoffed, "Most of them are. And, about that, actually..." She pulled her legs off of her desk and slid her chair closer to it. "I was looking into them. It kinda seems like most of them are working with either..." Kasey looked down at her desk, in apparent disappointment. "What?" Cisila asked, sitting down on the other side of Kasey's desk. "...They have control over law enforcement. They can basically get away with anything, if they can pay." Kasey explained, and she took a smoke. "One of the three groups also works with PALMER-EDEN. At least, that's what this source I found says." She slid a piece of printed paper over to Cisila, who picked it up and read it. It was a news article from several months ago, seemingly having been taken off the internet. It detailed how one of the three Syndicates in the city, the Dragons, were hauling goods around and getting rid of loose ends for PALMER-EDEN. "Holy shit..." She mumbled, scanning the article. "How did you find this?" Kasey leaned forward, "Get this. Dani helped me out. They got it from the police HQ." *The HQ?* Cisila's eyes went wide. Kasey snuffed out her cigarette, and said, "Well...it wasn't them, actually...but they still helped. Dani got one of their people to get in and steal some evidence. Guy named Zephyr, I think." Cisila had heard Dani mention someone by that name before. Maybe he was just really good at his job? "Okay," Cisila said, putting down the paper, "I've got something for you aswell." And she pulled out the man's phone and wallet, placing them on the table. "The guy's ID might be in that wallet. And if you can crack that phone..." She stared down at it, "I think it might be worth something." Kasey grabbed the wallet and went through it, pulling out a driver's license. "Bingo." She said, and read out the name. "He was a guy named Joseph Coal." Kasey pulled open her laptop, and put the license down as she began to search the name. "I should be able to get *something* to confirm that he's the leader. Just give me a sec." 

Cisila reclined in her chair, and pulled out her phone. The sun was beginning to set, and in Kasey's office, no lights were on. Shadows cast by the city outside loomed around Cisila and Kasey, as the sun lowered slowly. Kasey clicked her tongue suddenly, "Bingo." she said. Kasey turned her laptop towards Cisila, and the screen displayed a picture that matched the man's look exactly. "This is him, a couple months ago." Kasey explained. "It's a news article. An exposé article written by a news reporter. It was pulled off the internet, but," Kasey slid a finger down the trackpad of the laptop, scrolling down the article. "I found it. It's definitely him." Cisila's eyes scanned the article, and, to her, it confirmed that it was indeed the man she was looking for. "It's got to be him." She said. "There's no way it isn't." Crossing her arms, she leaned back in her chair, "Which means we have another problem..." Cisila said, and Kasey nodded. "Who killed him?" Kasey asked. "And why?" Cisila sighed, tapping a finger on her forearm while her arms were crossed. "I think we need to figure out if there's something going with the three Syndicates." She said. "If there's something going on with them, we can rule it out as a casualty of gang warfare. That narrows it down, doesn't it?" Kasey turned her laptop back towards herself, and stretched. "I- think so." She said, stretching her arms over her head. "But there's kind of only one way to confirm that..." Cisila cocked her head, "How?" She asked. "The police keep a sharp eye on the Syndicates." Kasey explained, "If you can get into their headquarters, into their evidence room or some shit- I bet you'll find something." Cisila nodded. "Right. I guess I'll get Dani to take care of that." She said, but Kasey shook her head. "I think you should do it. Dani's not gonna be inclined to help." Cisila pursed her lips. "Right...fine." She uncrossed her arms and got up, "I'll go get some sleep, then. I'll message you when I'm about to leave for the station, so you know." Kasey nodded, and said, "Good luck.". Cisila opened one of the many windows in Kasey's office and leaped out, using her grapple gun to propel herself across the street. For now, she'd head back home.

#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 24

Cisila was sitting at her desk in her small bedroom. The only light on in the room was her desk lamp, which shone down on her desk. A blue-green measuring mat covered most of the desk, and it was covered in metal and wood shreddings, and stained with paint. However, it was mostly covered by a large set of blueprints. Careful diagrams of a firearm had been sketched out on the blueprints, with all of its measurements written properly. Cisila herself was tinkering with a thin barrel, that of which matched the diagrams. Holding the end of the barrel to her eye, she looked down it. *The bore's wrong.* The interior of the barrel, the bore, looked slightly incorrect. Lopsided. *And I messed up the rifling...* The rifling inside, which twisted around the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a spin, looked wonky aswell. She groaned, and dropped the barrel on top of the blueprints, which thunked quietly. *Why can't I get this right?* She leaned over her desk and covered her face with her hands. *Every single day that I try this, I mess up.* The barrel, like her blade, had been constructed by her ability. She could make *anything* with it. So long as she either had blueprints or made them herself, she could build anything complicated. *If I tried hard enough, I could probably make an entire house...* She thought, hands still in her face. *But right now, I can't even make the barrel of a gun.* She'd made things herself before, obviously- her blade and the throwing knife. Those had taken her months to make aswell, but this gun she'd been trying to make...it had easily taken a year, and all she had done was the most simple parts. *The grip.* She lowered her hands from her face. As soon as the image of the grip flashed through her mind, it appeared in her hand, clicking together. It was made of a couple parts, but due to how simple it was, it was easy to make. The slide, too, was simple. It was a little rough, but as the pistol grip disappeared and the slide appeared in her hand, she remembered how long ago she'd last made progress. *Months.* Cisila thought. *It's been months since I made any progress.* She leaned back in her chair and sighed, dejectedly. 

The sun was almost completely out of sight, and her room was mostly shadows. Cisila wasn't sure whether to go to the police headquarters doing the day, or night. At night, the headquarters was probably quieter. And during the day, most officers and people on the force would be there. One was clearly easier- but frankly, she was already tired enough as is. Rather than getting it over with, she felt like she needed a decent amount of sleep and a cup of coffee before she even thought about trying to break into the goddamned *police headquarters.* Rubbing her eyes gently, she got up from her chair, and stretched. Ever since she'd gotten home, about an hour ago, she'd been tinkering. Sitting there. Doing nothing. A waste of time. Again. She linked her fingers together, and raised her arms over her head, arching her back. Her spine crackled. *Sitting for too long again...* Unlinking her fingers, Cisila sat down on her bed. As soon as she did, she noticed that it had begun raining, rather hard. Realizing how tired she was, Cisila fell backwards onto her bed. The rain hitting her window was the only noise she could hear, other than her own breathing. Slowly, her eyes closed. She was just too tired to bother changing. Drifting into sleep, her breathing slowed. But, suddenly, a noise pierced her ears. A sharp knocking on her door. Cisila bolted upright and shook her head, "What-" she blurted. Quickly getting up and leaving her room, stumbling into the main room, she pulled open the apartment's front door. Nobody was there. Cisila blinked. "Huh?" She mumbled, "...What?" Leaning out of the doorway, she couldn't see anyone. But as she looked around, she saw something on the floor...blood. Spatters of blood lined the hallway from the elevators, up to her door, and away from it in the other direction. Someone, definitely bleeding, had tried to get her help. At least, that's what she thought. 

<sup><sub>Note: Cue Irritation from LIKE A DRAGON Infinite Wealth</sub></sup>

Quickly, she snatched her satchel off of the coat hangar and pulled it on, aswell as getting her shoes on before she stepped out the door. Shutting it behind her, she decided to follow the trail of blood. Walking down the hallway, she kept her eyes on the blood. It looked fresh. It *had* to be from whoever had knocked on her door. She followed it down the stairwell at the end of the hallway, and watched carefully as the puddles of blood seemed to grow. Whoever was bleeding, she could it was getting *worse.* If Cisila couldn't catch up, they'd probably bleed out. She picked up her pace and went down the stairs as fast as she could. The trail went down through an empty hallway behind the lobby, and out through a service entrance that went out into an alleyway. She ran down the hallway and pushed the door open, heaving it out of her way. Stepping out into the dark and wet alleyway behind her apartment, she saw who it was. A man was keeled over on the ground, clutching his sides. Bleeding far, *far* too much. Cisila rushed over to him, and crouched next to him. "Hey- hey-" She said, grabbing his shoulders, "Did you knock on my door?!" The man looked up at her, "Oh my god..." he mumbled, groaning. "I didn't...think...I could get to you. Thank God." Cisila felt a lot of concern suddenly. "What-? Why were you trying to get to me?" She asked, gripping his shoulder. "Tell me. Please." The man slowly sat up, shaking his head, "I had...something to give you. I'd have done it digitally, but...being watched." He seemed to struggle to put words together, and Cisila knew that he was losing too much blood. She couldn't help him, not in this state, but she needed to know *why* he'd come here. "Why? *Why?"* She said, louder. "Please!" 

He groaned, and tried to pull something out of his jacket. "I heard, from...a- a friend...that you're trying to investigate the gangs. I have something for you- it's- it's really..." He gasped for air. "Come on!" Cisila pleaded. "Just tell me. There's-" she swallowed, "- there's nothing I can do for you, but if you tell me...it'll do something. Please!" Why had this man been injured? And by who? Slowly, he pulled out a manilla folder that looked filled to the brim. "It's this. You need to read it- Take it." He shoved it towards her, and she snatched it up. "The Syndicates...they're trying to stop me. Got shot on my way here- but- my friend, they told me you were trustworthy. They told me *you* could do something." Cisila squinted at him, *Who? Who was this friend?* But as she opened her mouth, the devastating ring of a gunshot filled her ears. The man had been shot in the head. Her eyes went wide and she quickly got up, *Shit-* She tried to shove the manilla folder into her satchel, but she wasn't able to. A firm hand gripped her forearm and tugged her back. Whoever it was tugged the folder out of her hands, and she immediately went into attack mode. She kicked backwards, and her leg made contact with the person's stomach. She lunged forward and rolled along the ground to get out of the way of this mysterious assailant, before pulling herself back up and turning to face them. Silently, they slid the folder into their jacket. They were wearing a mask, and had a hood on. She couldn't tell if they were female, male, or even neither. They wore a simple jacket and black, slightly ripped jeans. *Jesus Christ, you're joking...* Cisila thought. She raised her fists, but the figure raised a hand. "No." They said. Their voice was modulated by the mask. "You want this stuff? You're going to have to fight a lot of us. And it *won't* be fun." They sneered. Cisila lowered her fists, silently watching the figure. She wouldn't give an answer. They stared at her, or at least, she *thought* they did. They lowered their voice, still seeming to speak in a rageful tone, "You'll find where you need to go on that man's person. Should be a photo." They turned away, and the moment they did, Cisila seized her opportunity. She lunged forward and yelled, "LIKE HELL I'LL DO THAT!", rushing at the figure. Forgetting where she was for a brief moment, she constructed her blade in her hands and brought it down on the mystery figure. As if they knew she'd do this, they whipped around and caught her blade between their hands- but their hands weren't normal. They had transformed into large, mechanical-esque claws. Her eyes went wide, but before she could even react, they kicked her away. "Nice try." They spat.

They pulled out a grapple gun and pulled the trigger, and the grappling hook latched onto the roof of the building behind them. "You're an absolute idiot, you know that?" They said. "You just showed yourself. We know who you are now." Suddenly, the cables of their grapple gun lifted them up to the top of the building, and they disappeared over it. Cisila stood there silently. *I wasn't thinking properly. Now somebody knows what I am. And if I heard that right...* She sighed. *Whoever that is, is going to tell the Syndicates.* Cisila walked over to the man's body, crouched, and started rummaging through his jacket. She found a photo that looked as though it was taken with an old Polaroid, and she pulled it out. Flipping it over to get a look at the picture, she almost immediately recognized. The photo showed a large tower-like building, curved almost like the letter "C". It was taken from the ground, looking up. But it was extremely recognizable. It was the largest still operating casino in the city. High-Stakes Casino, it was called. Bland. *And it's owned by one of the Syndicates.* The only reason it was still operating. *The Cobras,* she remembered. Looking up at where the mysterious figure disappeared, the pieces clicked together. They wanted her to go here, and find that folder. *Is this some kind of game?* She thought, standing back up. *Now I've got two different, extremely tiring things to do.* Sliding the picture into her satchel, she decided that it really wasn't a good time to bother with this stuff. Heading back inside, up the stairwell, and back into her apartment, she took her shoes off and slung her satchel back on the coat hangar. Yawning, she walked into her bedroom, fell face first onto her bed, and passed out.

Hours later, she was now at her small kitchen inset. It was now the morning of the 30th, and her mind was whaling at her. *Get things done! Get them done!* It echoed. Cisila attempted to ignore it, because for the time being, she felt *bad* just thinking about doing any of that. She desperately wanted to ignore the situation, to just disappear. It was too much for her to handle at this point, but, as she washed her dishes, her mind continued to yell at her. Louder. And louder. *DO IT!* It yelled. *Just GET IT OVER WITH! It can't be THAT big of a deal!* But it WAS a big deal. If she stepped foot near that casino, she would be walking right into a trap. Right into her *death,* if she did anything wrong. Grinding her sponge against the dirty plate, cleaning off the gunk, Cisila felt herself falling into a loop. She'd probably be here for the next hour, cleaning an already sparkling plate. But she couldn't break herself out of the loop, because she didn't want to move. It felt as if though she needed someone to kick her out of her house in order for her to get anything done today. Her mind was going blank- she was forcing herself to stop thinking. But just as she managed to empty her mind of her mental voice, her phone buzzed. And it buzzed again. Cisila looked down at it, where it was sitting on the counter. Sighing, she put down the sponge and the plate, dried her hands, and picked up the phone to answer. *It's Dani. What does she want?* She thought, answering the call and holding her phone to up her face. "Hey." Cisila mumbled. "Yeah, and good morning to you too." Dani replied, over the phone. "I heard from some trustworthy people that you've gotten yourself into a spot of trouble." Cisila's stomach dropped. *Great.* She thought. "...Yeah, I guess so." Cisila mumbled. "It's not that big of a deal, though, I-" But Dani stopped her, "No. You *don't.* The man that was murdered? A news reporter. He was communicating with us, and that folder we know he had? We need it." Cisila sighed, "Shit, then. I've got to get it, don't I?" She said, dejectedly. "Well, I considered my options. Do you know where the stupid thing was taken?" Dani asked. "Yes. High-Stakes." Cisila replied. "Oh. Hm." Dani muttered, thinking. Cisila moved over to her couch, and sat down, picking the photo of High-Stakes off of her small table. "Isn't it owned by the Cobras? And that man, he..." Cisila started, trying to figure out the words, "...he said it was important information. Someone said I needed it. And then he got shot." Dani took a good moment to respond, before saying, "Yes. We know. We asked him to get that information." *The Brotherhood. Of course...* Dani continued, "We told him to bring it directly to an informant, but, it seems like he didn't. He was injured by a few Syndicate members, then fled. To your house. Something must have changed his mind." Cisila nodded, and replied, "Right. But why me?" Dani sighed, and muttered, "Couldn't tell you," before raising her voice, "Point is, though, you need to get it back. But from High-Stakes? You're not doing that alone." Cisila's brow furrowed. Was Dani going to accompany her? That wasn't their style. Blinking and getting herself back on track, Cisila mumbled, "Right. So what's the plan then?" Dani then began to explain.

"Well, first and foremost, it's not going to be me. I've got too many things to do today. I'll get Zephyr to go with you- he's pretty suited for this kind of thing, I think." *Zephyr.* She recognized that name. It had something to do with Kasey... "He'll follow you like a shadow until you get attacked- which, let's be honest, is a surefire occurrance- and he'll jump in to help you. Once you get their attention, you need to find out where in the casino they're keeping that thing. Should be simple." Dani continued to explain, before Cisila suddenly blurted out, "So- hang on-" She shook her head, "I'm just going to waltz in like I own the place?!" She exclaimed. "Yes. You're not sneaking through there. Security's tight, y'know? Not worth it to sneak through." Dani replied, "Better to bust some skulls than to waste time." Cisila thought about this- and realized Dani was correct. At least, from her point of view. There wasn't any time to waste- they might destroy the evidence in the folder. Realizing this, and how desperate the man seemed, Cisila got up. "Got it, then. I think I'll just get this over with now. Can you get that guy ready to follow me?" She asked, firmly. Her mind was set. "What?" Dani seemed slightly shocked. "Uh- Okay. I was thinking you'd do a little later in the day..." Cisila shook her head, "No. Hell no. This is top priority. I've got a thing or two to ask those Syndicate fucks anyways." she asserted. "I'm going." *This is a terrible idea.* Her mind echoed. *No, no it's not...is it? It is. No, it's not.* The inside of her mind was like a waging war between *Bad idea* and *Just get it over with*, and she had decided to get it over with. Quickly, she got ready. Pulling on the jacket she used for going out as V, she walked into her bedroom and pulled up the loose floorboard where she hid her mask. It sat there silently. And she picked it up, and stashed it back inside her satchel, of which she'd already pulled on. Cisila pulled open the window in her bedroom and climbed out, shutting it behind her. The cool air of midday September hit her pretty fast, as she pulled her mask on. It clicked and seemed to fasten to her face easily, as she leaped off the fire escape and used her EXO's grapple gun just as she had a couple nights previously. She was heading straight for High-Stakes.

Cisila landed in the expansive outdoor entrance to the High-Stakes Casino, and stared up at the large building. It was one of the biggest buildings in the city, aside from the skyscrapers. It stood as a momentous achievement for organized crime- something the police somehow couldn't do anything about. But nobody seemed to be around. Of course, it was the middle of the day. She'd heard from customers at the bookstore that the casino only properly opened at night. But the doors were wide open...all, what, eight of the large glass doors leading into the lobby? Taking a few steps towards the entrance carefully, she strained her eyes to look through her mask. There was nobody to be seen. No Syndicate members. No nothing. She stepped into the lobby slowly, looking around. The lobby itself was a massive expanse, with plenty of waiting space and a large desk for multiple employees to be at during work hours. There was no ceiling...when you looked up, you could see every single floor curved around the building, where it was open all the way to the very top of the building, which finally closed off, so no rain would get in. It was ridiculous. This building not only felt like a waste of money, it felt like a waste of time to build. As she walked through the lobby and through yet another set of doors, Cisila entered the first floor. An even wider expanse that stretched around the building, filled with things to do. It was like a luxury hotel- but with ten times the amount of gambling machines. Anybody who came here to gamble clearly had nothing to lose. But in the centre of the first floor, there was a large stage. It was circular, with no curtains around it. Cisila got a bad feeling, as she jogged up the steps onto it to get a better look at the first floor. Almost every seat not attached to a gambling machine was facing the stage. As she looked around at the seats, she realized where she was standing. *Well, that's a little awkward.* Cisila continued to turn around, staring at the giant casino.
