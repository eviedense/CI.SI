#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 25

It felt that, for a moment, it was all over. Palmer stumbled backwards, bruised and bleeding. Cisila felt like all of her energy was spent. Her entire body was in pain, and just like Palmer, she was bruised, and bleeding profusely. A cut on her lip stung particularly badly. The sun was rising behind her, illuminating the shadowy room. Behind Palmer, Lyla, Kellien, Kasey and Zephyr watched the two. Cisila's shoulders rose and fell as Palmer spat out blood. He heaved himself upwards, pushing his hands against his thighs. His cybernetic arms, synthetic black and gold, had scrapes on them. They were no longer pristine. Cisila stared at him as he stood up, and she spotted a crack in his thin glasses' lenses. "...Stop." Cisila said, wiping her lip. Palmer stared at her, silently. "Just...*stop.*" She repeated, out of breath. Shaking her head, she took a deep breath, and stood up properly. "You can't win." Cisila began, "All of your secrets...all of your scheming...every single news outlet knows." As she spoke, Palmer stared into her eyes, malice etched into his expression. "You're...hilarious." He said. "I can fix this in a snap of my fingers." He too was out of breath. He couldn't fight much longer. "They're all lies for anyone who gets enough money." Palmer hissed, taking a step forward. His foot slid along the floor of his office. "And when there's nobody to tell the secrets, they stay buried." Cisila took a step back, flicking her wrists. She was keeping a careful eye on Palmer. "I'll *fucking* fix this." He hissed. "You can't stop me when you're dead." And suddenly, he let out a desperate yell. \
Cisila barely had a moment to react when Palmer suddenly lunged straight at her. Lyla and the others yelled out, but it was too late. Palmer's metal hands grasped onto Cisila's shoulder so hard that she felt the fingers dig into her muscles. Cisila grappled with him, trying to get him to let go. But he wouldn't. He forced Cisila towards the window and suddenly threw her against it, and to her surprise, the entire window shattered behind her, leaving her nowhere to go but down. But as her foot slipped off the edge, she flung her left arm out and used her EXO's grapple to latch onto him. The cable shot out and stabbed Palmer in the chest, and she pulled him out with her. The pieces of shattered glass gleamed in the rising sun as the two fell towards the helipad a couple dozen feet below them. Palmer tried to punch Cisila while in the air, but she yanked the cable and sent him off course. It felt like an eternity. Falling, falling, *falling.* But she slammed into the helipad after a few seconds and painfully tumbled across it as she landed, her momentum still going. Palmer hit the helipad too, on the other end. Back near the access door to the helipad, while she was out near the edge. Cisila slowly pulled herself up, despite her body screaming in protest. Her arms hurt. Her hands had gone numb. She must've been limping. But it didn't matter. Palmer, no matter what, would never hurt another soul again. And if Cisila had to kill him, this was the best way it could've gone. No one to interrupt them. \
The man who killed her mother. The man who had Dani killed. The man who had driven Mikhail to insanity. As he got up aswell, Cisila stared at him, breathing slowly. The man had ruined countless lives, including her own. But, being honest with herself, this was for her. For her mother. With the others around, she had to force herself to see reason, despite her anger. But here, alone, she refused to stop herself. Palmer finally stood up, struggling. Behind him, just above the helipad, was the massive PALMER-EDEN logo. But behind her was the rising sun. What Palmer saw was a silhouette behind the sun. A figure standing in the way of the city. But Cisila could only see Palmer. Slowly, Martin Palmer raised his fists again. The metal fingers clenched. And he lunged at Cisila. She went straight for him. This was it.

Each of their fists went into the other's stomach. Cisila stumbled, but forcefully slammed her fist into Palmer's jaw before he could do anything else. He stumbled back, and Cisila followed up with a series of deliberate, slow and heavy blows. One. Two. Three. Each punch landed, and she felt a crack each time they did. Palmer, in retaliation, kicked her away, and she skidded away, sliding along the rough material of the helipad. He jumped into the air and tried to punch downwards on Cisila, but she ducked out of the way and sent a right hook straight into his face. As Cisila's fist went into Palmer's face, his head whipped away and he stumbled. Cisila flung her leg up and kicked him not once, not twice, but three times in succession. But Palmer, regaining control of the fight, blocked and countered her final kick. He grabbed hold of her leg and lifted her up, flinging her closer to the edge of the helipad. She pulled herself up just in time to see Palmer lunge at her in order to throw her off the edge. Scrambling out of the way, she stumbled and turned to face Palmer. "FUCK!" He screamed, "What...is your goddamn problem?!" He hissed, walking towards her. "I am *sick* and *tired* of this. You don't understand what's good for you. You don't understand what I've done for this country." *For this country.* She thought, striking her defensive stance and moving away from him. "All you've done, huh?" She said. As she stared into Palmer's eyes, she felt her anger bubble up again. "I don't give a shit what you've done." She hissed. The two started circling, Palmer not wanting to get close. "I couldn't care less if you improved this country, because it's already at the fucking rock bottom. It's still shit, after all you say you've done." Cisila continued, "The only thing I care about right fucking *now* is getting my revenge." Palmer sighed, frowning. "You're pathetic." He said. "You're-" Palmer tried to continue, but Cisila cut him off. "*Shut up.*" She hissed. "Shut the fuck up. I'm done listening to you." She couldn't hold her anger in. "You're the one who's pathetic. You hid in your tower all this time, and when we came to get you, the first thing you thought of was to run. The only thing you're good at is hiding your problems, and running from them. \
"And this is what happens when you keep running from them. They catch up. You killed my mom. You killed Dani." Her breathing was getting shallow. "If you were a better human being, this wouldn't happen. But..." She blinked, "But the investors, the country, and the government made you forget what real people feel." \
Palmer stared at her. If he had words, he refused to say them. And Cisila just kept going. "You have all your feelers in every part of the country. Infecting it. Making it worse than it already was." She said, "You're making people's lives harder. And you refuse to see that. \
"You choose to ignore all of it. What is *fucking* wrong with you?" She asked. "What makes a person like you ignore people? You preach that your products will improve life, but behind everyone's backs, it's all fake. You just keep making everything worse, and in ways people will never see or understand. The people you killed, mutilated, or...brainwashed..." Cisila blinked, forcing her feelings down. "They're not even people to you." She breathed in. \
"But *you* aren't a real person anymore." She hissed. "You feel no remorse. Not even when the one you're ordering killed is your friend. Someone who had a family." The two continued to circle, while Palmer just...stared. "How does that *fucking* happen?" She asked again. Palmer opened his mouth, but he didn't speak. He slowly shut it. It was like Cisila had back him to a corner, and there was nothing he could do. Confronted by the personification of his problems, Palmer could no longer run. 

Instead, Palmer shook his head. "FUCK THIS!" he screamed, sprinting at Cisila. She felt herself go numb as she realized that he couldn't see reason. Despite the fact that she wanted to kill him, there was a part of her that knew it wasn't right. But as she felt herself drift away, she automatically caught and countered Palmer's last ditch attack. She whirled him around towards the edge and pushed her leg against his back, putting all of her strength into *pulling his arm off.* He fought back as hard as he could, but nothing stopped her.

The cybernetic arm whirred and screeched in protest before it suddenly ripped apart at the shoulder joint. Palmer's face went chalk white. Cisila pushed him off the edge with her foot, and threw down his right arm. \
Peering over the edge, Cisila saw Martin Palmer plummet towards the ground. Quietly, she shut her eyes, and let out a deep sigh.

*That didn't feel worth it.* \
*It didn't feel like I got revenge for anyone.*

Opening her eyes back up, she looked at her hands. Her knuckles were bloodied. Slowly, she looked up at the sky, lowering her hands. *I don't know if it what's you wanted, Mom, but I did it.*

*I hope you aren't disappointed in me.*
