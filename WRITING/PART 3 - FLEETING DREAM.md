#### CISILA J. SIVETA, 25

It felt that, for a moment, it was all over. Palmer stumbled backwards, bruised and bleeding. Cisila felt like all of her energy was spent. Her entire body was in pain, and just like Palmer, she was bruised, and bleeding profusely. A cut on her lip stung particularly badly. The sun was rising behind her, illuminating the shadowy room. Behind Palmer, Lyla, Kellien, Kasey and Zephyr watched the two. Cisila's shoulders rose and fell as Palmer spat out blood. He heaved himself upwards, pushing his hands against his thighs. His cybernetic arms, synthetic black and gold, had scrapes on them. They were no longer pristine. Cisila stared at him as he stood up, and she spotted a crack in his thin glasses' lenses. "...Stop." Cisila said, wiping her lip. Palmer stared at her, silently. "Just...*stop.*" She repeated, out of breath. Shaking her head, she took a deep breath, and stood up properly. "You can't win." Cisila began, "All of your secrets...all of your scheming...every single news outlet knows." As she spoke, Palmer stared into her eyes, malice etched into his expression. "You're...hilarious." He said. "I can fix this in a snap of my fingers." He too was out of breath. He couldn't fight much longer. "They're all lies for anyone who gets enough money." Palmer hissed, taking a step forward. His foot slid along the floor of his office. "And when there's nobody to tell the secrets, they stay buried." Cisila took a step back, flicking her wrists. She was keeping a careful eye on Palmer. "I'll *fucking* fix this." He hissed. "You can't stop me when you're dead." And suddenly, he let out a desperate yell. \
Cisila barely had a moment to react when Palmer suddenly lunged straight at her. Lyla and the others yelled out, but it was too late. Palmer's metal hands grasped onto Cisila's shoulder so hard that she felt the fingers dig into her muscles. Cisila grappled with him, trying to get him to let go. But he wouldn't. He forced Cisila towards the window and suddenly threw her against it, and to her surprise, the entire window shattered behind her, leaving her nowhere to go but down. But as her foot slipped off the edge, she flung her left arm out and used her EXO's grapple to latch onto him. The cable shot out and stabbed Palmer in the chest, and she pulled him out with her. The pieces of shattered glass gleamed in the rising sun as the two fell towards the helipad a couple dozen feet below them. Palmer tried to punch Cisila while in the air, but she yanked the cable and sent him off course. It felt like an eternity. Falling, falling, *falling.* But she slammed into the helipad after a few seconds and painfully tumbled across it as she landed, her momentum still going. Palmer hit the helipad too, on the other end. Back near the access door to the helipad, while she was out near the edge. Cisila slowly pulled herself up, despite her body screaming in protest. Her arms hurt. Her hands had gone numb. She must've been limping. But it didn't matter. Palmer, no matter what, would never hurt another soul again. And if Cisila had to kill him, this was the best way it could've gone. No one to interrupt them. \
The man who killed her mother. The man who had Dani killed. The man who had driven Mikhail to insanity. As he got up aswell, Cisila stared at him, breathing slowly. The man had ruined countless lives, including her own. But, being honest with herself, this was for her. For her mother. With the others around, she had to force herself to see reason, despite her anger. But here, alone, she refused to stop herself. Palmer finally stood up, struggling. Behind him, just above the helipad, was the massive PALMER-EDEN logo. But behind her was the rising sun. What Palmer saw was a silhouette behind the sun. A figure standing in the way of the city. But Cisila could only see Palmer. Slowly, Martin Palmer raised his fists again. The metal fingers clenched. And he lunged at Cisila. She went straight for him. This was it.
