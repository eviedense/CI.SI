### - On Cisila's EXO & Construct

*Cisila flexes her fingers. They feel stiff. She then stretches, feeling her spine crack a little as she does. She leans further back and rolls her shoulders. She can feel the EXO running along her spine.*

Cisila - *She sighs.*

*Lyla is pacing around her. She looks tired, as usual.*

Lyla - What? *Lyla doesn't speak too loudly. The silence is too much.*

Cisila - *Her eyes flick towards Lyla, one hidden underneath her hair.*  It's nothing. *She says that, but Lyla knows she's lying. Everybody lies when they say something like that.*
