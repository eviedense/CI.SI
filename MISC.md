### - On Cisila's EXO & Construct

*Cisila flexes her fingers. They feel stiff. She then stretches, feeling her spine crack a little as she does. She leans further back and rolls her shoulders. She can feel the EXO running along her spine.*

Cisila - *She sighs.*

*Lyla is pacing around her. She looks tired, as usual.*

Lyla - What? *Lyla doesn't speak too loudly. The silence is too much.*

Cisila - *Her eyes flick towards Lyla, one hidden underneath her hair.*  It's nothing. *She says that, but Lyla knows she's lying. Everybody lies when they say something like that.*

Lyla - You look...uncomfortable. *Lyla notices the bags under Cisila's eyes. She's even more tired than Lyla herself.*

Cisila - I- *Cisila stammers for a moment,*  Yes. A little. 

*Lyla sighs and stops pacing. She turns on her heel towards Cisila.*

Lyla - I don't know if you've noticed, but you look like you've been awake for days.

*Cisila has. She's very aware of this. In fact, it's the EXO in her spine that's made her lose sleep. She can't lie down without it causing her pain. She would roll from side to side, but nothing would fix it.*

Cisila - *She takes a moment, considering her next words. An awkward silence.*  ...Yeah. I- I can't sleep.

*Lyla raises an eyebrow. She seems worried.*

Lyla - Right. *Lyla's tone changed. She doesn't enjoy it when Cisila isn't happy- and it's showing.* Why?

Cisila - *She groans. She holds her palm out and metal parts construct themselves in her hand. They come together like a complex puzzle.*  It's this. It's acting up again. *She crushes the parts in her hand, and they stab her hand. She feels her lip twitch.*

*Lyla puts her hand on Cisila's, and opens her hand up again. She carefully picks the metal pieces out of Cisila's hand and flicks them away.*

Lyla - Don't do that... *Lyla runs her thumb along the small wounds the sharp metal parts created in Cisila's hand.*

*Cisila tries to pull away. She doesn't like being touched.*

Lyla - ...What's the matter?

*Cisila's eyes meet Lyla's.*

Cisila - My spine. It hurts like hell when I try to lie down.

*Lyla cocks her head to the side.*

Lyla - And you're sure it's your...whatchamacallit?

Cisila - *She rolls her eyes.*  I call it...EXO. It's- it's like the exoskeleton of some armor that wraps around me.

Lyla - *She nods.*  Gives your muscles a boost, right?

Cisila - Yeah. *For the first time in days, Cisila properly smiles.*  Helps a lot, usually.

Lyla - Mhm. *Lyla slides a hand into her bag and pulls out a small roll of bandages.*  Can you sit still? 

Cisila - *She slowly nods. She doesn't think she needs* that *much first aid.*  It's not that bad, though-

Lyla - You're bleeding. *Lyla is still pressing her thumb against one of the punctures.*  Pretty badly, too. Just- sit still.

*Cisila does just that. She stands as still as she can.*

Lyla - *She begins to wrap Cisila's hand in a bandage. Looking closer, she can tell it's not the first time Cisila's done that- on purpose or not. The metal punctures fairly deep in, and it makes Lyla slightly nervous.*  Why doesn't... *She thinks for a moment.*  ...why doesn't your EXO fix your wounds?

Cisila - It's- *She sighs. She doesn't like talking about the EXO like this.* It can't fix wounds. The only thing it could do would be to...artificially fill the wounds. I can't make skin. I can't make anything alive.

*Lyla's brow furrows.*

Lyla - Why can't it do that? *She seems genuinely curious.*

Cisila - *She shrugs. She has no idea why she can't create anything alive- let alone skin. To her, the EXO and its Construct feel like one half of a puzzle. The other half...the actual armor, and the ability to create living things.*  It- it just can't. Trust me, I've tried.

Lyla - *She mumbles something that vaguely sounds like "Damn, unfortunate...", and finally finishes putting the bandage on.*  I don't...I don't really get how your Construct works, either.

Cisila - *She exhales. Clasping her hands together and feeling the bandage, she again, shrugs.*  It's complicated. I can't just go, *bang,* a sword. I still have to design it, y'know? *She holds out her left hand and her metal blade folds out from her hand. After dozens it reiterations, it looks like a complicated blade.*  This thing started out as a terrible piece of jagged metal because I couldn't understand how to do *anything* with Construct. *She twirls it around, away from Lyla, before it folds away into her hand.*

Lyla - *She watches the blade, intrigued.*

Cisila - *Cisila seems to remember something, suddenly. Her face lights up- the tiredness slips away.*  Hey- this is really neat. Watch this!

Lyla - *She opens her mouth to say something, but only gets a word out.*  Huh-?

*In Cisila's hands, morphing cubes appear. They pulsate and twitch, looking unnaturally like pixels. Colored a solid steel gray, Cisila tosses them from hand to hand, and they seem to know where they're going. Each toss ends up in the exact same place. And then...the cubes morph together and slither up Cisila's arm. Lyla gasps.*

Lyla - What the hell is it-

*Cisila holds up a finger. She knows what it's doing.*

Cisila - Just watch.

*The cubic metal snake slithers up her neck and splits apart. It coils itself into a wire, and jams itself into Cisila's neck. It doesn't look like it hurts, but Lyla can't help but twitch. The rest of the strange thing snakes its way around the rest of Cisila's body, slowly constructing the EXO. Messy wires, hinges, and metal sprawls around Cisila's body. Despite it going through her clothes, it doesn't seem like they've been ripped.*

Cisila - Isn't it neat? *She holds her hands out. The EXO constructed a sturdy case around her fingers, and her wrists. Wires run from the finger parts back to the wrists. On her left arm, something that looks like a grapple gun is strapped on.*

*Lyla is lost for words.*

Lyla - I knew it would just appear, but I didn't know it would- *She struggles for words*  - do that.

Cisila - *She nods. And then the EXO suddenly slips off her arms and folds into her back. It disappears into her spine with several metallic clicks.*  I don't know it's hurting me, it's just...it happens sometimes.

Lyla - Right...it's not *alive* though, is it? *To Lyla, it certainly looked alive.*

Cisila - I- I dunno. It doesn't feel like it.

Lyla - *She nods. She seems less concerned, but a little wary of the EXO.*  I can...try and help with it, if you want.

Cisila - *Cisila thinks about that.*  Mmm...really? It feels like it's not my spine, but the EXO...

Lyla - *She puts her hand on Cisila's shoulder.*  Let's just try it.

- END

### - On Dani, & The Brotherhood

*Cisila is sitting on the rooftop of her apartment, alone. Waiting. The cold night air feels like it's constantly biting her as she waits.*

*Then suddenly, she hears a soft thud behind her. She turns her head to look, and Dani is walking towards her with their hood on.*

Cisila - What took you so long?

*Dani doesn't reply at first, choosing to sit down next to Cisila.*

Dani - Long day. *They pull down their hood, revealing their white-blonde hair, and their light, but sallow skin. They don't look tired, just...strange.* 

Cisila - Didn't need me?

Dani - *They shake their head.*  No. None of the scouts like you, either, so...

Cisila - *Her brow furrows and her face slides into confusion.*  Why don't they like me?

Dani - *They let out a long sigh, fidgeting with their fingers.*  I don't know. They just don't like that I like you.

Cisila - Oh. *Cisila looks up at the sky.*  Hm. 

Dani - I've got something for you, actually. *They reach into their jacket and pull out a thin package. They reach over to Cisila and drop it in her laps.*  My dad said you'd want it.

Cisila - Uh... *She picks it up, and turns it over, trying to figure out what it is. She gives up.*  ...Wh- what is it?

Dani - *They tilt their head. They look unconcerned*  Just open it.

*Cisila tears open the package, and shoves her hand in. Her fingers touch a string, and she twines them around it, pulling the thing inside out. She holds it up. It's a necklace.*

Cisila - Huh? *She looks confused. She doesn't need another necklace.*

Dani - *They shake their head.*  Look at it. *They point to the charm that the string is attached to.*

*The charm is pieces of metal banged and welded into a jagged 'V' shape.*

Dani - My dad made it. For the old V. *They sigh.*  Everybody liked her.

Cisila - *She puts the necklace into her satchel slowly. She'll wear it later.*  I don't get it...

Dani - Get what?

Cisila - *She shifts uncomfortably. She's not sure if she wants to ask.*  Why do the names matter? And why give that one to me?

Dani - *They look around for a second, thinking on their words.*  Well...I- I thought you had the same amount of skill as the old one. My dad agreed. It's just...I think nobody likes that you've replaced her. She was like a big sister to everyone.

Cisila - *She leans back against the cold brick wall behind her.*  ...Am I misunderstanding something? I thought you were a makeshift gang.

Dani - No. *They shake their head.*  We're not. We don't steal, and we don't get involved in the Big Three's pointless struggles. We defend the city from anything coming in- not something already in. *They pause.*

*An awkward silence follows.*

Dani - It's why one of the scouts almost went for you the first time you tried to do something. *They settle their hands on one of their knees.*  Anything vaguely foreign puts everyone on edge.

Cisila - But I-

Dani - *They hold a finger up. Shush.*  You were gone from Chicago for months, and when you came back...you were different. That rings alarm bells for us. But you proved yourself when you took down that scout without killing him. 

Cisila - And that was enough for you?

Dani - You... *They sigh.*  You had something going on. I wanted to figure out what it is- my dad did, aswell.

Cisila - I've...never met your dad. Why do you keep mentioning him?

Dani - *They shrug.*  He agrees with me.
