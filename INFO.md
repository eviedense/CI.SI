# STORY | SYNOPSIS | EVERYTHING ELSE

There is no easy way to explain how the story is set up other than one way.
I'll include Spotify song links for each 'part' that will help you get the vibe I'm going for, along with a brief 'passage' in prose that you'd expect to read if this were a book.


# PART 1
Part 1 is where we begin. It starts with Cisila's daily life, showing her normal routine throughout a week. Wake up, go to work, come home & wait for her boyfriend, then disappear into the dark after hours. But she finds something strange, something unnatural that she didn't anticipate to find on the day we join her perspective. A dead body - the victim of a murder. But the body is stuck to the ceiling. Not by tape, or any other means you might expect. It almost seems like the body has had its gravity flipped. Following the trail of small pieces of evidence Batman style, she'll begin to figure out what the murderer is doing. One single organ is missing from every victim, but how isn't clear, as there's no evidence of surgery done on the body to remove the organ. And it's always a different one. Her clues lead her a bit close to the sun...and she attracts the attention of whoever's doing this. They send their henchman (or hired bodyguards, at least) and someone else...who also has the superpower-like abilities of Cisila, just different, obviously. The first encounter isn't much, just a warning - but that obviously doesn't deter Cisila. The deeper she goes, the more in danger she becomes (as V, not as herself). 

Eventually, it gets to the point where this killer *needs* to kill her. So he sends the bodyguards, and the other person with powers. Boom, bang, epic fight. The other person demonstrates their ability: it turns out, they were the one who could flip gravity. This completely disorients Cisila. She loses, and the only one left alive (the other person) brings her to the murderer. Yeah, so, remember that boyfriend I mentioned once? He dunnit. Even worse, Cisila was already beginning to not like him - and was silently falling in love with a coworker/best friend at the library. Lyla. And you know what? SHE'S THERE TOO. SHE'S THE OTHER PERSON. When Lyla takes off Cisila's mask, she's shocked. They're friends. She can't just kill her...

The boyfriend (I swear I'm gonna update this when I get a name for him I LITERALLY just came up with this plot point a couple days ago and it's so much better than what I had before) disagrees. He's disillusioned by his mission. What's his mission? Create the most optimal human being. And now that he knows who Cisila is, and what her abilities are (having seen them demonstrated, probably via videos online of 'V') he decides to take 'em. Lyla immediately turns on him (at this point, it's not clear why she was even working with him. Money? That would just make her terrible.) and promptly throws him out the window, and unties Cisila. She explains the objective her boyfriend was trying to do - and it's revealed that, he too, has an 'ability'. It's how the corpses had no signs of surgery, or even injury at all. And Lyla divulges her abilities to Cisila: the gravity manipulation, obviously, and some kind of electric grapple line that shoots out from her fingers, allowing her to coil them around one person and effectively subdue them.

Blah blah blah, they go kick the boyfriend's ass and get vengeance for the *many* people he killed for absolutely no reason. 
There's a bunch of other details that don't belong in this synopsis (such as Cisila's lighthouse hideout with Dani, and Cisila's motorbike) That I'll explain in-depth on their own in their own little files.

Context for all of these is too much to include here (it'd be going over scenes that I already went over) so guess.


# PART 2


Part 2 is where things are supposed to get a little more clear. Cisila's origin, the reason for her vendetta, etc., etc. 
It starts at least a month after the first part ends. Cisila's at home, when suddenly - she hears a window smash. In her bedroom. She rushes in, only to see someone diving out the window, having one of her blueprints (the ones she makes to assist her in constructing stuff using her ability) and immediately goes after him - not having time to change into her V outfit, only able to put the mask on. Eventually, she catches the thief, and it's revealed that he knows who she is. He was trying to see if he too, could do these things. And she recognizes him - he's the only son of the CEO of PALMER-EDEN. But he doesn't look healthy, he looks pretty tortured. And then she notices the most important thing: his arms have been replaced with cybernetic augmentations. Professional military-grade prosthetics only in use by the Army. He seems to have been an experiment.

Once she explains her situation to Adam (that's his name), they consolidate their experiences with PALMER-EDEN and agree that they have to take it down. Adam is supposed to be the radical one of the group, while the others (Lyla & Dani) are the reasonable ones. This part of the story is supposed to be a tug of war, basically, between Cisila's conscience and what she wants to do. I'm not exactly sure what needs to happen during this part of this story, but I explained the idea. That's what's important.

The 'third act' we'll call it is probably based around ramping up the action, wherein the CEO finally notices his son is gone - and sends a security force after him, and subsequently, the rest of the team. Upon being asked if the team should be killed, and one of the soldiers points out they have abilities, the CEO tells them to "Capture them.". The only one who actually gets captured is *Lyla* of course, because, y'know, conflict. This finally sparks Cisila's radical side, and without Lyla to keep him down, Adam manages to convince Cisila that she needs to get Lyla back, no matter the cost. Yeah, there's supposed to be a cool train set piece that happens here- Lyla, being transported who knows where, and Cisila & Adam have to hop on the train and fight through it- starting on the roof.
Again, boom, bang, epic fight. Weeee! Eventually, they cause the train to crash. And due to the route it's taking, it crashes in a pretty bad area to crash in. Cisila gets Lyla out, Dani shows up, and Adam's still there. This is where the CEO and COO finally show themselves...and they don't look too good. It looks like, eventually, they ended up experimenting on themselves. They have more augmentations than Adam, but it's clear they also gave themselves a few abilities, taken from test subjects. 

GUESS WHAT. ANOTHER DEFINITELY EPIC FIGHT. I swear there's a lot of shit going on here. I just can't explain it in a synopsis like this.

Cisila, Adam, Lyla, and Dani fight back (as they've no other choice) and the battle gets pretty bloody. By the end, with the CEO and COO at their knees, Adam takes his chance. He snatches Cisila's pistol, holds it to the forehead of the CEO, and pulls the trigger before anyone can stop him. Adam just killed the CEO of a major company right in the middle of a city (that's where the train crashed). And this'll set up part 3. Adam breaks away from the group, disappearing into the shadows. Cisila, Lyla & Dani don't have enough time to leave before the media shows up. Of course. Duh. That's when the COO takes her chance, and grabs Lyla again. She seems to have regained the strength she lost during her fight with Cisila. Cisila, left with no other choice, has to stab the COO. Once she's free, the gang bolts, leaving the scene.

# PART 3

Part 3 is probably the most chaotic. After the events of the last one, Cisila's gotten in trouble. *Major* trouble. It turns out the U.S government keeps records of all the superpowered individuals, and she was on that list. Unfortunately, someone from the government must have recognized her due to the commotion that Adam caused. They know she's a part of the problem, and connect the dots, and figure out that she's V, unfortunately for her. Instead of arresting her, they give her a 'deal'. Join the Army as part of a classified squad, or die. It's not a deal. Obviously, it's the U.S government.

Naturally, she accepts. She's put into a squad named Delta Squad. There are six members in the squad (including her). DELTA-PRIME, DELTA-2, DELTA-3, DELTA-4 (he'll be important) DELTA-5, and Cisila herself, DELTA-6. She notices that a couple of the other members have abilties, but when their first mission comes, their commander gives them these strange metal arm bands, and instructs them to put the bands on. They do, obviously. These completely constrict their abilities, and stop them from using them. It then becomes clear what the purpose of the squad was. The mission seemed like it would benefit greatly from the superpowered abilities, but without them, it'd be suicide. And that...was the point. There wasn't really a deal that Cisila accepted, she just delayed her demise. But, the team works so well together that despite the odds, they get through their first mission. This...continues to happen. The team works efficiently, figuring out the least suicidal way to complete every mission they're sent on.

Eventually, they get a big one. This mission concerns the whole army, though, so they'll have to work with other squads (like them). The mission is supposed to be reminiscent of the HECU's goal in Half-Life, until the Army decides to nuke Black Mesa. Destroy the threat by all means necessary by boots on the ground and air support. But obviously, like Half-Life, it's suicide. Apparently the biggest military base out in Nevada is under siege by a strange man, using his abilities to take over the personnel and turn them into zombies (zombies that can use guns). He seems to also be able to create strange organisms from his hand, almost like a variation of Cisila's ability, but focused on giving life.

There are two ways I've thought of the squad entering: A VTOL that crashes into the cliffside of the base, and they have to rappel up and get inside. The second would be a mishap with drop pods. Like in Halo, they'd be put in drop pods and ejected straight into the LZ. Obviously, something bad happens. This is how storytelling works.

Either way, they end up inside the facility, with about half or so of the squad disconnected. They make their way through, meeting soldiers here and there, and some personnel at the base that haven't been 'infected' so to say. Once they get outside, they see the absolute chaos. Basically, all I'll say here is, refer to Chapter 13: Forget About Freeman in Black Mesa. That's how bad this is supposed to be. And currently is.
