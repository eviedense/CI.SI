# STORY | SYNOPSIS | EVERYTHING ELSE

There is no easy way to explain how the story is set up other than one way.
I'll include Spotify song links for each 'part' that will help you get the vibe I'm going for, along with a brief 'passage' in prose that you'd expect to read if this were a book.


# PART 1
Part 1 is where we begin. It starts with Cisila's daily life, showing her normal routine throughout a week. Wake up, go to work, come home & wait for her boyfriend, then disappear into the dark after hours. But she finds something strange, something unnatural that she didn't anticipate to find on the day we join her perspective. A dead body - the victim of a murder. But the body is stuck to the ceiling. Not by tape, or any other means you might expect. It almost seems like the body has had its gravity flipped. Following the trail of small pieces of evidence Batman style, she'll begin to figure out what the murderer is doing. One single organ is missing from every victim, but how isn't clear, as there's no evidence of surgery done on the body to remove the organ. And it's always a different one. Her clues lead her a bit close to the sun...and she attracts the attention of whoever's doing this. They send their henchman (or hired bodyguards, at least) and someone else...who also has the superpower-like abilities of Cisila, just different, obviously. The first encounter isn't much, just a warning - but that obviously doesn't deter Cisila. The deeper she goes, the more in danger she becomes (as V, not as herself). 

Eventually, it gets to the point where this killer *needs* to kill her. So he sends the bodyguards, and the other person with powers. Boom, bang, epic fight. The other person demonstrates their ability: it turns out, they were the one who could flip gravity. This completely disorients Cisila. She loses, and the only one left alive (the other person) brings her to the murderer. Yeah, so, remember that boyfriend I mentioned once? He dunnit. Even worse, Cisila was already beginning to not like him - and was silently falling in love with a coworker/best friend at the library. Lyla. And you know what? SHE'S THERE TOO. SHE'S THE OTHER PERSON. When Lyla takes off Cisila's mask, she's shocked. They're friends. She can't just kill her...

The boyfriend (I swear I'm gonna update this when I get a name for him I LITERALLY just came up with this plot point a couple days ago and it's so much better than what I had before) disagrees. He's disillusioned by his mission. What's his mission? Create the most optimal human being. And now that he knows who Cisila is, and what her abilities are (having seen them demonstrated, probably via videos online of 'V') he decides to take 'em. Lyla immediately turns on him (at this point, it's not clear why she was even working with him. Money? That would just make her terrible.) and promptly throws him out the window, and unties Cisila. She explains the objective her boyfriend was trying to do - and it's revealed that, he too, has an 'ability'. It's how the corpses had no signs of surgery, or even injury at all. And Lyla divulges her abilities to Cisila: the gravity manipulation, obviously, and some kind of electric grapple line that shoots out from her fingers, allowing her to coil them around one person and effectively subdue them.

Blah blah blah, they go kick the boyfriend's ass and get vengeance for the *many* people he killed for absolutely no reason. 
There's a bunch of other details that don't belong in this synopsis (such as Cisila's lighthouse hideout with Dani, and Cisila's motorbike) That I'll explain in-depth on their own in their own little files.
