Using her abilities, Cisila is able to fend off a group of attackers. Swift combinations of punches and kicks will for sure knock down an enemy, and if the environment allows for it, Cisila will use the environment to her advantage. She'll take hold of garbage cans, signs, or bikes to take down the attackers in devastating attacks, inspired by *Like a Dragon's* Heat Actions.

### Part 0 - Childhood to Adulthood - 2009 Onwards
Cisila Jane Siveta is the daughter of PALMER-EDEN scientist Marta Siveta & U.S Marine David Siveta, and lost both of them by the time she was aged eighteen.

But before that, her upbringing was simple. Every week, after school, David would teach Cisila the things he'd learned in the military - in the hopes that Cisila would be able to defend herself properly, had the need ever come. Proper CQC training and how to wield firearms, when she was old enough, was what Cisila learned from her father. A valuable tool in her life.

Her life moved on. Soon, Cisila found what she wanted to become. A mechanical engineer. Mechanics always interested her, and the prospect of being able to make her own things felt like *just* what she wanted to do.

Her father died during a military conflict, and his body was never recovered. Her mother was killed in front of Cisila herself, by three men with guns - sent by PALMER-EDEN CEO Martin Palmer, for something it would take Cisila a couple of years to understand. Cisila harbors a personal vendetta against Martin for not only killing her mother, but using Cisila as a means to punish her mother. A month or so before her mother was killed, Cisila was kidnapped and put under for PALMER-EDEN's Ultima Program. She was given the organ that grants one the ability of a superpower. Hers turned out to be the ability of creation, called Construct, and the EXO suit that improves her strength, agility, and defense. But these abilities felt like they came at a cost: without her mother, Cisila had nobody to go to. And the memory of her mother being shot through the head right in front of her...something had changed her. It felt as though anxiety came from that memory. Anxiety came from *existing.* It wasn't something she could get rid of. Eventually, everything started to feel anxiety inducing. But she just had to force her way through it.

Not understanding how to use the powers, and now alone, Cisila left Montana, where she had been living with her mother and father. She went south, for the time being, and found her sister, Joan Siveta, who was currently working out in the middle of nowhere, as a fire lookout. Cisila joined her, and stayed for a few months. There, she used her free time to understand her Construct and EXO. Cisila couldn't make anything, but she understood the theory.

Cisila moved to Chicago, now understanding her abilities, and was hellbent on ending Martin Palmer. Years passed, and eventually, she got a grip on how to use Construct - she made herself a blade, throwing knives, and attempted to construct a firearm. It didn't work. She knew how to make a firearm, having studied them out of interest, but for whatever reason, she could never get it to work. And that too, caused her stress. She thought she'd never be good enough to make one. 

### Part 1 - Vendetta, and the Spider's Web - 2034

#### Day & Night

Cisila, now twenty four, works at the Crimson Bookstore in Chicago. She spends her days restocking books, checking to make sure everything's in the right place...and feeling tired. Because every night, she leaves her apartment with a mask on, and tries to find her mothers' killers. Over her years of investigation, with help from a new friend, Kasey, Cisila has figured out that the murderers may have come from the Syndicates, a trio of gangs stationed in Chicago.

In a desperate attempt to stop PALMER-EDEN's development of Ultima, Cisila decides to plant a bomb in one of their supply trucks, intending for the bomb to go off long after the truck has stopped. However, it explodes on the freeway...killing dozens of people.


#### Zero Hour, and the Murderer

Only a few hours after the incident, Cisila discovers that one of the men who killed her mother...has been murdered. Investigating the crime scene, she discovers the man's identity: the patriarch of the Dragons Syndicate. The murderer has a specific M.O, and Cisila is tasked by Dani and their Brotherhood to find the murderer. Kasey suggests that Cisila break into the Chicago PD's HQ, to gather what they have on the murder - if anything.

On the trail of the murderer, someone suddenly knocks on the door to Cisila's apartment. She sees nobody, except for a trail of blood - which she follows. The man who knocked on her door turns out to be some kind of journalist, and he gives her evidence that he had been holding onto, much to the chagrin of the murderer. He is killed in Cisila's arms, by a masked assailant with strange, metal claws. Cisila believes they are the murderer.

The assailant steals the file the journalist was intending to give to Cisila, and strangely, gives her the location that they are going to leave it at. 

Cisila assaults the location, a Syndicate owned casino, and makes her way to the top floor. There, she meets the new Patriarch of the Cobras - Dan. She learns that the murderer has also killed the former Cobras Patriarch, which muddies the waters even more.

#### Police, or Criminals?

Now having her hands on the file, Cisila sorts out all of the evidence, making the picture slightly clearer. Realizing that some parts are missing, Cisila remembers Kasey's suggestion: Break into the police headquarters. But she doesn't feel ready. 

For a brief pause on her investigation, Cisila invites Lyla, someone she has a desperate crush on, over for dinner. Her anxiety suddenly ramps up, and, in a moment Cisila didn't expect, Lyla comforts her. Lyla understands...

And that made Cisila feel much better than she had in years. With her newfound confidence, Cisila invades the police headquarters, evades capture, and escapes with the files she needs. The police have dubbed the killer the *Barracuda,* and have been ordered to stop...by someone outside of the police, someone with power.

The one who ordered them to stop, was the new Dragons Patriarch. However, nobody knows who he is. Not even Dan.

But Cisila needs a break, desperately.

#### Burned Out

Getting back to her apartment, Cisila announces to Kasey over the phone that she's got the evidence. Quickly, they sift through the evidence. The Dragons Patriarch is extremely hard to find, Kasey explains, but Cisila knows she can call Dan up - who was very invested in the case when he met Cisila.

However, for now, she needs a break. This is almost immediately put on hold when Mikhail, her ex-boyfriend, whom called her just after she planted the bomb, appears at her door. They talk, but Mikhail leaves quickly, with a strange parting message. Somehow, he knows Lyla.

With Lyla on her mind, Cisila thinks it might be a good idea to go out for dinner with her. She feels...happy, around Lyla. Eventually, the two head out for dinner, and on the pier, at night, they kiss. Cisila's heart flutters.

#### The Spider's Web, and the Barracuda

Cisila calls up Dan, and requests to meet the Dragons Patriarch. When she explains why, Dan realizes how terrible the situation is. He agrees, and the two head to the Dragons' current lair, an abandoned school. There, they meet the Dragons Patriarch, the murderer...

Mikhail. Cisila can't believe it. The two stare at each other, tensions rising. Both of them realize who the other is. Taking Dan out of the fight, leaving him out cold, Mikhail engages Cisila in a fight, and cue *Viper* from Lost Judgment for his first fight.

Cisila gets a message from Lyla. But it's not Lyla- it's *Mikhail.* He tells Cisila that he's taken Lyla, and to get her back, she's got to fight the Dragons. 

Finding the location that the Syndicate has taken Lyla to, an under construction tower, Cisila assaults the site. Fighting to the top, Cisila finds Lyla. 

Lyla attacks Cisila, revealing herself to be the Barracuda, the metal-clawed assassin. In pure shock, Cisila goes on the defensive against Lyla, but her unstoppable attacks take Cisila down - and she is captured.

#### Wounded Beast

Waking up in the Dragons' lair, the abandoned school, Cisila is met with Mikhail- and Lyla. Mikhail briefly tortures Cisila by bashing a hammer against her head, fracturing her skull. He cuts one of the wires coming out of her eye, where the Ultima organ anomaly is. It hurts like hell.

Mikhail picks up a sledgehammer, handing it to Lyla, and tells her to bash Cisila's head in. She approaches Cisila, and for a brief moment, it looks like she'll do it. A moment of tension ensues, before Lyla whips around and bashes Mikhail's head in, knocking him down for a brief moment. Lyla takes her chance, and frees Cisila, imploring her to run.

Cisila doesn't. Mikhail, getting up just as Cisila gets to the door, attacks Lyla. Cisila immediately turns around as her EXO activates, and sprints at Mikhail. Cue *Triplet After Triplet* for the second fight against Mikhail as lightning strikes, rain batters against the windows, and thunder strikes. 

Lyla and Cisila lose. Mikhail leaves them to die in the rain, as the fight went outside. The two lie in the mud, dying. But one final thought comes to Cisila, and she gets Lyla to call Dani, before Cisila herself passes out.

A week later, Cisila wakes up in the lighthouse. She finds Dani and Lyla there, who have become fast friends. The three plan to figure out how to find evidence to pin Mikhail as the murderer with solid proof, and Cisila remembers- she never took the folder from the police HQ, only photos of the note on it- the one telling the police to stop.

Their goal now is to get that back, amidst an overtaken police headquarters. Syndicate teams disguised as SWAT officers are armed and waiting. Cue *Un altro appassionato* as they enter the headquarters, joined by Kasey. This is the first time the quartet has assembled, all with the same goal, the same understanding of the situation, and most importantly: Their fists.

#### The Destination, but For Whose Sake?



### Part 2 - Adam and Eve - Early 2035

#### From the Garden of Eden...

Four months after Mikhail is apprehended and sentenced to the rest of his life in jail, Cisila is still in Chicago, and still trying to find a way into PALMER-EDEN, to end their experiments. With the help of Lyla, Cisila has discovered several entrances to the PALMER-EDEN skyscraper, most of which are closed off, or locked with keycards.

One night, Lyla tails a PALMER-EDEN convoy, which stops in some kind of warehouse. She calls Cisila, who swiftly joins her, and the two survey the situation. A crate, looking like it would fit an average human, is pulled out of one of the vans. Cisila speculates that it might be another Ultima victim, which Lyla agrees with. The two take on the PALMER-EDEN security in the warehouse, and retrieve the man inside the crate. Rescuing him, Lyla and Cisila leave with him quickly, and find out his name. Adam.

### Part 3 - Hell on Earth, And The End of Eden - Late 2035

#### Alone, Yet Surrounded

After Adam's murder of the small Ultima population and causing chaos in Chicago, Cisila has been contacted by the U.S government, and forced to enlist as part of an elite fireteam made specifically of Ultima: she speculates that the reason for this is to round up every remaining one, and kill them off in a way where nobody will notice.

On her first mission as DELTA-SIX in Delta Squad, Cisila is sent on a stealth mission into enemy area to retrieve data and get evidence that a terrorist organization exists. It's almost suicide, but when she gets caught, the rest of Delta Squad saves her. The squad captain, Kellien, has brute forced her way through every single mission, and has never lost a member...until the loss of the previous DELTA-SIX, and for the time being, she simply believes that Cisila is a replacement, and not a move by the U.S government to guarantee her death.

#### Night & Day 

It's a normal day for Cisila and her detective agency. She's chasing after a suspect who's spotted her, across the rooftops. They're fast. But Cisila is able to keep up. Catching them, she retrieves plans for a Carbine Industries space station- she was called by Maria Palmer to find the person who stole them. Retreating to her agency, Cisila suddenly gets another call from Maria, who seems distraught. She explains to Cisila *not* to give the space station plans back to Carbine, and to instead keep them hidden in her agency. Cisila agrees, but asks why. Maria tells her she's found something out about Carbine that connects it to Chicago's Syndicates- The Eagles, Dragons and Cobras. Ever since the Adam incident, the Dragons and Eagles have gotten new patriarchs, while Dan has remained steadfast as the Cobras' patriarch. 

Maria believes Carbine, like PALMER-EDEN once did, is using the Syndicates for profit. Off the books killing, money laundering, and organized theft of supplies. She begs Cisila to look into it, and she agrees. If Carbine is trying something like this, it means they're gunning for the position that PALMER-EDEN once held.

#### Hidden Between the Walls of Carbine

Sneaking into Carbine Industries Chicago, Cisila investigates the place. Initially, she doesn't find anything- but her disguise as a repairwoman seems to be solid. Nobody notices her, except for Maria. Cisila manages to get a hold of an access keycard, allowing her to get into the backdoor areas of the Carbine building. Getting inside, Cisila sees Syndicate members talking to a group of Carbine employees. She recognises some of the Syndicate members, but others elude her. She stays out of sight and decides to follow the Syndicate, planning to see which of the three Syndicates the group belongs to.

Changing into her usual getup, Cisila tails the group as they get into a car. She climbs onto the rooftops and follows after them, pulling her mask on. As the car nears an intersection, it's suddenly T-boned by a larger van. More Syndicate members climb out of the van and drag the ones in the car out- all Cisila can tell is that this is clearly indicating a war between the Syndicates. She leaps down to break up the fight, only to be met by a familiar face climbing out of the van. Dan. He feels different...he acts different. He *looks* different. It's not the Dan who helped her before.

Dan doesn't greet her. She's about to retreat as another vehicle pulls up, and members of the Dragons pile out of it, squaring off against Dan's Cobras. Backing away, Cisila is instead greeted by the new Dragons patriarch. It's clear to Cisila that the guy knows what he's doing, and he quickly explains the situation: Dan has gone off the rails with the backing of Carbine, and caused a city wide Syndicate war. To get Carbine to stop their unethical practices, Cisila has to deal with the Syndicates again, and the new patriarch has a plan.

Dissolve all three groups, *forcefully*. And there's only one way to do so - bring those who are considered legends in the Syndicate, and show them what Dan's doing. By this point, all honour the Syndicates may have had in the past are gone. And the unfortunate new form of the Cobras is proof.

#### Syndicate Problems, and the Cargo Ship

The new patriarch describes Dan's new base of operations: A cargo ship docked in the city, filled with containers- most are empty. The whole ship functions as the Cobras' headquarters, the winding hallways and tight rooms functioning as their new quarters, planning rooms, and storage. Dan, with this much power, won't be convinced to dissolve the Cobras. But one of the captains, fortunately, is sympathetic to the cause. The only reason the man hasn't left is because Dan would kill him. The patriarch and Cisila need to coordinate a plan to meet with the captain and figure out a way to assemble all three Syndicates, aswell as write up a declaration for all three Syndicates. The Eagles need to be informed of this aswell, and the Dragons patriarch is...unsure of how the Eagles patriarch will react, to say the least. Cisila remembers the previous one she'd fought, a psychopath with a knife. She feels uneasy about going to meet with the new one, but agrees that they need to go find the patriarch.

Quickly, they find that the Eagles have bought out the upper half of the Pierce Building- the same place where Adam killed Dani. The two head up, joined by Kasey now, and greet the patriarch. To Cisila, there's still an aura of...insanity to the man, but he seems a little more reasonable than the last patriarch. She feels a bit uncomfortable around the man, however, as he keeps staring at her. His eyes are like daggers. The Dragons patriarch takes control of the conversation, and brings up the dissolution. The Eagles patriarch agrees that it's likely a good idea, but he doesn't seem to be paying attention. Cisila can still see his eyes flicking back towards herself every so often. Kasey has a hand on one of her pistols in its holster. The entire room is filled with an uneasy feeling. Cisila settles her hand on her dropleg holstered SOCOM MK23. The Eagles patriarch, beginning to helm the conversation, gets up from his seat at his desk. *"I'll give you a deal."* He says, to the Dragons patriarch. *"I don't tell Dan a thing, and you give me her."* He points at Cisila.

Immediately, Cisila and Kasey both draw their pistols and aim them at the patriarch. The Dragons patriarch backs up, as the Eagles patriarch walks around his desk, slowly heading towards Cisila. *"It'll have to be by force, then, it seems."* He says. Cue our first boss fight, against the Eagles patriarch, Han Daehyun. Backed by *Yakuza 6's* "Theory of Beauty", Daehyun is faster than his predecessor, and doesn't use a knife. His bare fists will do. He disarms both Cisila and Kasey, and the two are forced to engage in a fistfight against Daehyun and the Eagles, as the patriarch calls down help. The group is unable to take down Daehyun, instead opting to run for it. This causes yet another schism, pitting the Eagles against the Dragons. The Dragons stand alone in the belief that the Syndicates must be disbanded, but that doesn't mean there aren't members in the other Syndicates who believe them aswell. They're contacted by a few Eagles and Cobras members, aswell as the older patriarchs. Chris, the old Dragons patriarch, aswell as the former Eagles patriarch. Both, despite what they've done previously, seem to recognize the Syndicates as more of a threat to normal life, ever since they returned to normal life. They offer their help, but Cisila is wary of them. However, the current Syndicate members that contact them seem to be higher-ups, and have the power to draw the groups together for the announcement. They just need to convince Dan- the Dragons patriarch is determined not to get rid of him, but rather talk sense into him.

Cisila isn't so sure he can.
