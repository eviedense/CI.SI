Cisila's basic hand-to-hand CQC fighting style, which she learned from her father and built on over her years of fighting. Swift jabs and fast combos combine to make an unbreakable offense, mixed with fast and swift dodges.

Using her abilities, Cisila is able to fend off a group of attackers. Swift combinations of punches and kicks will for sure knock down an enemy, and if the environment allows for it, Cisila will use the environment to her advantage. She'll take hold of garbage cans, signs, or bikes to take down the attackers in devastating attacks, inspired by *Like a Dragon's* Heat Actions.

### Part 0 - Childhood to Adulthood
Cisila Jane Siveta is the daughter of PALMER-EDEN scientist Marta Siveta & U.S Marine Augustus Siveta, and lost both of them by the time she was aged eighteen.

But before that, her upbringing was simple. Every week, after school, Augustus would teach Cisila the things he'd learned in the military - in the hopes that Cisila would be able to defend herself properly, had the need ever come. Proper CQC training and how to wield firearms, when she was old enough, was what Cisila learned from her father. A valuable tool in her life.

Her life moved on. Soon, Cisila found what she wanted to become. A mechanical engineer. Mechanics always interested her, and the prospect of being able to make her own things felt like *just* what she wanted to do.

Her father died during a military conflict, and his body was never recovered. Her mother was killed in front of Cisila herself, by three men with guns - sent by PALMER-EDEN CEO Martin Palmer, for something it would take Cisila a couple of years to understand. Cisila harbors a personal vendetta against Martin for not only killing her mother, but using Cisila as a means to punish her mother. A month or so before her mother was killed, Cisila was kidnapped and put under for PALMER-EDEN's Ultima Program. She was given the organ that grants one the ability of a superpower. Hers turned out to be the ability of creation, called Construct, and the EXO suit that improves her strength, agility, and defense. But these abilities felt like they came at a cost: without her mother, Cisila had nobody to go to. And the memory of her mother being shot through the head right in front of her...something had changed her. It felt as though anxiety came from that memory. Anxiety came from *existing.* It wasn't something she could get rid of. Eventually, everything started to feel anxiety inducing. But she just had to force her way through it.

Not understanding how to use the powers, and now alone, Cisila left Montana, where she had been living with her mother and father. She went south, for the time being, and found her sister, Joan Siveta, who was currently working out in the middle of nowhere, as a fire lookout. Cisila joined her, and stayed for a few months. There, she used her free time to understand her Construct and EXO. Cisila couldn't make anything, but she understood the theory.

Cisila moved to Chicago, now understanding her abilities, and was hellbent on ending Martin Palmer. Years passed, and eventually, she got a grip on how to use Construct - she made herself a blade, throwing knives, and attempted to construct a firearm. It didn't work. She knew how to make a firearm, having studied them out of interest, but for whatever reason, she could never get it to work. And that too, caused her stress. She thought she'd never be good enough to make one. 

### Part 1 - Vendetta, and the Spider's Web

#### Day & Night

Cisila, now twenty four, works at the Crimson Bookstore in Chicago. She spends her days restocking books, checking to make sure everything's in the right place...and feeling tired. Because every night, she leaves her apartment with a mask on, and tries to find her mothers' killers. Over her years of investigation, with help from a new friend, Kasey, Cisila has figured out that the murderers may have come from the Syndicates, a trio of gangs stationed in Chicago.

In a desperate attempt to stop PALMER-EDEN's development of Ultima, Cisila decides to plant a bomb in one of their supply trucks, intending for the bomb to go off long after the truck has stopped. However, it explodes on the freeway...killing dozens of people.


#### Zero Hour, and the Murderer

Only a few hours after the incident, Cisila discovers that one of the men who killed her mother...has been murdered. Investigating the crime scene, she discovers the man's identity: the patriarch of the Dragons Syndicate. The murderer has a specific M.O, and Cisila is tasked by Dani and their Brotherhood to find the murderer. Kasey suggests that Cisila break into the Chicago PD's HQ, to gather what they have on the murder - if anything.

On the trail of the murderer, someone suddenly knocks on the door to Cisila's apartment. She sees nobody, except for a trail of blood - which she follows. The man who knocked on her door turns out to be some kind of journalist, and he gives her evidence that he had been holding onto, much to the chagrin of the murderer. He is killed in Cisila's arms, by a masked assailant with strange, metal claws. Cisila believes they are the murderer.

The assailant steals the file the journalist was intending to give to Cisila, and strangely, gives her the location that they are going to leave it at. 

Cisila assaults the location, a Syndicate owned casino, and makes her way to the top floor. There, she meets the new Patriarch of the Cobras - Dan. She learns that the murderer has also killed the former Cobras Patriarch, which muddies the waters even more.

#### Police, or Criminals?

Now having her hands on the file, Cisila sorts out all of the evidence, making the picture slightly clearer. Realizing that some parts are missing, Cisila remembers Kasey's suggestion: Break into the police headquarters. But she doesn't feel ready. 

For a brief pause on her investigation, Cisila invites Lyla, someone she has a desperate crush on, over for dinner. Her anxiety suddenly ramps up, and, in a moment Cisila didn't expect, Lyla comforts her. Lyla understands...

And that made Cisila feel much better than she had in years. With her newfound confidence, Cisila invades the police headquarters, evades capture, and escapes with the files she needs. The police have dubbed the killer the *Barracuda,* and have been ordered to stop...by someone outside of the police, someone with power.

The one who ordered them to stop, was the new Dragons Patriarch. However, nobody knows who he is. Not even Dan.

But Cisila needs a break, desperately.

#### Burned Out

Getting back to her apartment, Cisila announces to Kasey over the phone that she's got the evidence. Quickly, they sift through the evidence. The Dragons Patriarch is extremely hard to find, Kasey explains, but Cisila knows she can call Dan up - who was very invested in the case when he met Cisila.

However, for now, she needs a break. This is almost immediately put on hold when Mikhail, her ex-boyfriend, whom called her just after she planted the bomb, appears at her door. They talk, but Mikhail leaves quickly, with a strange parting message. Somehow, he knows Lyla.

With Lyla on her mind, Cisila thinks it might be a good idea to go out for dinner with her. She feels...happy, around Lyla. Eventually, the two head out for dinner, and on the pier, at night, they kiss. Cisila's heart flutters.

#### The Spider's Web, and the Barracuda

Cisila calls up Dan, and requests to meet the Dragons Patriarch. When she explains why, Dan realizes how terrible the situation is. He agrees, and the two head to the Dragons' current lair, an abandoned school. There, they meet the Dragons Patriarch, the murderer...

Mikhail. Cisila can't believe it. The two stare at each other, tensions rising. Both of them realize who the other is. Taking Dan out of the fight, leaving him out cold, Mikhail engages Cisila in a fight.

Escaping, Cisila suddenly doesn't feel safe. Dan, now awake and still alive, assures her that this will get solved, quickly. But almost immediately, Cisila gets a message from Lyla. But it's not Lyla- it's *Mikhail.* He tells Cisila that he's taken Lyla, and to get her back, she's got to fight the Dragons. 

Finding the location that the Syndicate has taken Lyla to, an under construction tower, Cisila assaults the site. Fighting to the top, Cisila finds Lyla. 

Lyla attacks Cisila, revealing herself to be the Barracuda, the metal-clawed assassin. In pure shock, Cisila goes on the defensive against Lyla, but her unstoppable attacks take Cisila down - and she is captured.

#### Wounded Beast

Waking up in the Dragons' lair, the abandoned school, Cisila is tied to a chair, and in front of her- is Mikhail. Cisila attempts to question him, but he dodges every single question. Lyla has disappeared, and in desperation, Cisila asks what he's done with Lyla. Mikhail replies, "Nothing. She's just doing her job."

Seizing the opportunity to escape when Mikhail leaves the room, Cisila cuts herself free of the ties, and attempts to escape. Fighting her way through the Dragons still in the Lair, Cisila finds herself in the old science room of the school, where Mikhail finds her again. The rain batters against the windows and the thunder rumbles. Cisila is forced to fight Mikhail.

She loses, barely escaping through a window. After escaping, Cisila collapses on the empty streets, in the rain, half dead. But someone lifts her up - someone helps her. It's Lyla. Quickly, Lyla takes Cisila to her apartment and attempts to patch her up - and attempts to explain what has happened.

She was forced to work with Mikhail under threat of her family finding out she's still alive. Cisila learns that she never knew that much about Lyla...and she decides to withdraw from the investigation, even if for just a few days. Lyla isn't safe, and neither is she. They need help, and safety - Dani. Kasey. They can help.

#### Destination

### Part 2 - Adam, But No Eve

#### From the Garden of Eden...

Four months after Mikhail is apprehended and sentenced to the rest of his life in jail, Cisila is still in Chicago, and still trying to find a way into PALMER-EDEN, to end their experiments. With the help of Lyla, Cisila has discovered several entrances to the PALMER-EDEN skyscraper, most of which are closed off, or locked with keycards.

One night, Lyla tails a PALMER-EDEN convoy, which stops in some kind of warehouse. She calls Cisila, who swiftly joins her, and the two survey the situation. A crate, looking like it would fit an average human, is pulled out of one of the vans. Cisila speculates that it might be another Ultima victim, which Lyla agrees with. The two take on the PALMER-EDEN security in the warehouse, and retrieve the man inside the crate. Rescuing him, Lyla and Cisila leave with him quickly, and find out his name. Adam.

### Part 3 - Hell on Earth, And The End of Eden

#### Alone, Yet Surrounded

After Adam's murder of the small Ultima population and causing chaos in Chicago, Cisila has been contacted by the U.S government, and forced to enlist as part of an elite fireteam made specifically of Ultima: she speculates that the reason for this is to round up every remaining one, and kill them off in a way where nobody will notice.

On her first mission as DELTA-SIX in Delta Squad, Cisila is sent on a stealth mission into enemy area to retrieve data and get evidence that a terrorist organization exists. It's almost suicide, but when she gets caught, the rest of Delta Squad saves her. The squad captain, Kellien, has brute forced her way through every single mission, and has never lost a member...until the loss of the previous DELTA-SIX, and for the time being, she simply believes that Cisila is a replacement, and not a move by the U.S government to guarantee her death.
