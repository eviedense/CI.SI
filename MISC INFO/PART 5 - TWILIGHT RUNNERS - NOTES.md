### Ideas for SIDE A of Twilight Runners: 
Cisila's plot should be styled a lot more like her earlier stories, but instead of being inspired by the *Yakuza* series, it'll directly feature the yakuza as the antagonist/driving force of the investigation. Kasey and Cisila are contacted by a detective from the Chicago PD, who tells them it seems like PALMER-EDEN assets are being moved to Japan. *Why* is this? The assets should be parts of the Ultima project, the Adam/Cyborg project codenamed MIRAGE, and most of the PALMER-EDEN security division. Obviously, none of this will be known until Cisila and Kasey actually *get* to Japan. \
Cisila learns that Stephanie has also been invited to Japan by her father, and the three link up and take a flight to Japan, Stephanie's Nissan Skyline being shipped ahead of time to Stephanie's father. Once they get to Japan, after finding a hotel, Cisila and Kasey meet with the Chicago PD detective who has also travelled to Japan, and they enter an old warehouse where the detective first learned of this oddity. Tire tracks and containers clearly from PALMER-EDEN vehicles are in the warehouse, but nothing is in them. How does this end? Is there a confrontation between the newly developed PALMER-EDEN security, now rebranded under a different name? Should it be SOLARSec or a different, new name? Should this be a section focused on tension because of the high-powered firearms and gear from the security, or is it a complete brawl? Remains to be seen. \
Cisila and Kasey escape nonetheless with the detective, and they find out where the security comes from, and find that their HQ is in Tokyo, Japan. Exactly where they are. But before they can enter the building, they are stopped by a mysterious figure. Returning from the epilogue, Amelia has followed Cisila to Japan. Nobody except Cisila knows what happened to her, and even then, Cisila doesn't recognize the girl. She only realizes who she is when she says what Cisila did to her, and goes in for an attack. How Kasey reacts, what Cisila does to stop her or convince her otherwise, is to be determined, but the fight ends off in Amelia disappearing as the Japanese Police arrive, and an acquaintance of the Chicago PD detective approaches, and tells the detective that a hunch he had was right. In disbelief, the detective turns towards Kasey and Cisila and explains that it seems like the remnants of PALMER-EDEN are getting help from the yakuza. The biggest yakuza organization in Tokyo at the moment, called the G≈çka Alliance. They are violent, and extremely organized to the point that even modern laws cannot stop them. Beneath Tokyo, their underground rings and casinos reign supreme. To understand what is going on with PALMER-EDEN, Cisila and Kasey need to engage with the yakuza, and Kasey might know a way in.

### Ideas for SIDE B
Obviously, this is Stephanie's story and is automatically more like INITIAL D and WANGAN MIDNIGHT as opposed to Cisila's yakuza story. The yakuza should still be involved, but I'm unsure of how. Should it be part of the idea that Stephanie's father is in debt because of the R32? The races may be set up by the yakuza, something that the street gang, the titular Twilight Runners, are unaware of. \
Speaking of, these are the Twilight Runners as follows: \
- Kawamura Takeshi, Nissan Skyline GT-R GF-BNR34 V-SPEC, gang leader. Not quite an antagonist, but a friendly rival. - Gets "DON'T STOP THE MUSIC" by Lou Grant for his road battle down the mountains and onto a highway, but probably not the Shuto Expressway because of how massive Tokyo is. 
- Akiyama Soma, Nissan GT-R (2017). Overconfident in his abilities and the car, he's lost more races than anyone else in the gang. The gang keeps him around because when he *does* win, it's a complete and utter destruction of the opponent. Gets "GAS GAS GAS" by Manuel for his road battle on the Shuto Expressway.
- Kuroda Daigo, Toyota Trueno AE86 GT-APEX, the "sleeper" of the gang. Extremely skilled, despite the appearance of the Toyota. - Fittingly gets "DEJA VU" by Dave Rodgers for his road battle in the mountains. The reference will only go as far as the car and the song, though.
- Kitagawa Mayumi, Mazda RX-7 Spirit R. Face of the gang, in her RX-7, and most notable of the racers. Her RX-7 is a legend in recent times. Gets "NO ONE SLEEP IN TOKYO" by EDO BOYS for her road battle, on the Shuto Expressway
- Goro Kousuke, Toyota Supra (modern or old model? not sure). Not sure about this character, needs some refinement. Gets "BURNING UP FOR YOU" for their road battle.

Additionally, there are the other non-Twilight Runners racers. Obviously, there's Talin in her Nissan Sileighty who appears unexpectedly. And the Mitsubishi Evo 3 that nearly causes Stephanie to crash in the opening, and turns out to be the catalyst behind a lot of the plot. They are linked to the yakuza, to Stephanie's father, and likely the PALMER-EDEN remnants aswell.
