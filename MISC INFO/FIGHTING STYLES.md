The essential to defense - your fists. This is how each character defends themselves.

# CISILA J. SIVETA

## VIGILANTE STYLE
### Theme: "Soul of the Ogre" - LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name
### https://open.spotify.com/track/5ztlbmHm1lbJ1GoGB5NMPq?si=ad148ddb97ec4898

Cisila's basic fighting style, without the use of any Construct weapons. She throws punches without remorse and forgoes any grace or swiftness, instead opting to beat her enemies to the ground before they can do too much to her.

In intense moments, she might utilize her surroundings in order to take down an enemy. If a wall's nearby, she'll bash her foe's head into it, and when they fall to the ground, she'll stomp on their face. Or, without any useful environment around, she can catch the enemy off guard, grab them by their face, and pile drive their head into the ground. Her EXO provides a good boost to defense, allowing her to counter enemy attacks and take great amounts of damage. 

With this style, all bets are off.

## METEORIC STYLE
### Theme: "Fog" - Lost Judgment

Cisila's second fighting style, utilizing her Construct. She can use her blade, her throwing knives, and eventually, her pistol. She is much more fluid and dynamic in this style, with her experience in swordfighting. She will cut apart enemies like they're nothing. One, two, and three slashes are enough to get an enemy down.

However, with her powers focused on Construct, her EXO's defense has gone down. Compared to Vigilante Style, she has next to no defense, so the name of the game here is fast and drastic movement, in order to avoid attacks. 

In addition to her blade, she can throw knives. These can temporarily immobilise an enemy for a good couple of seconds, allowing Cisila to get a kill in easier. Her pistol is reserved for drastic situations, and requires a lot of focus to construct. It might be used against a particularly tough foe, or to clear out a crowd. 

With this style, heads will fall.

# LYLA SILVERMANN

## ASSASSIN STYLE
### Theme: Receive You the madtype - Yakuza Kiwami
### https://open.spotify.com/track/1AQiYec9NdkkXdsvtmnDU7?si=02142fdbbb91467b

Lyla's primary fighting style. She uses her assassin training to make swift and lethal attacks against enemies using a plethora of assassin tools she's gained over the years. A pair of daggers, poison darts and flashbangs. She uses these tools in a very technical manner, making sure never to get hit- seeing as she is unarmored. 

With her daggers, she can repeatedly stab enemies in critical areas without spending too much time - and with her tools she can disable her foes' ability to see, hear, or have them drop their weapon.

With this style, critical thinking is key.

# DANI JOSERTÃ‰

## LION STYLE
### Theme: Hellish Octagon - LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name
### https://open.spotify.com/track/1fTuPDQjBMBu9aFWF0X4t0?si=c6309ca76fbc4862

Dani's signature hand-to-hand style, which was taught to them by their father. Swift punches and kicks end in a decimated enemy, and no resistance can stop The Lion. The pure *force* that Dani puts to use will end all their foes' hopes.

In intense moments, Dani might take advantage of their surroundings - similar to Cisila. With their strength, any objects not tied down to the ground can be put to use - and smashed into the faces of their foes. Even an enemy themselves may be flung right back at their allies as if they were a bowling ball.

With this style, anger is everything.
