The essential to defense - your fists. This is how each character defends themselves.

# CISILA J. SIVETA

## VIGILANTE STYLE
### Theme: "Soul of the Ogre" - LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name
### https://open.spotify.com/track/5ztlbmHm1lbJ1GoGB5NMPq?si=ad148ddb97ec4898

Cisila's basic fighting style, without the use of any Construct weapons. She throws punches without remorse and forgoes any grace or swiftness, instead opting to beat her enemies to the ground before they can do too much to her.

In intense moments, she might utilize her surroundings in order to take down an enemy. If a wall's nearby, she'll bash her foe's head into it, and when they fall to the ground, she'll stomp on their face. Or, without any useful environment around, she can catch the enemy off guard, grab them by their face, and pile drive their head into the ground. Her EXO provides a good boost to defense, allowing her to counter enemy attacks and take great amounts of damage. 

With this style, all bets are off.

## METEORIC STYLE
### Theme: "Fog" - Lost Judgment
### https://open.spotify.com/track/5ES2Zd2i3zjJlLWkp1rei2?si=8d05f9e21b01461b

Cisila's second fighting style, utilizing her Construct. She can use her blade, her throwing knives, and eventually, her pistol. She is much more fluid and dynamic in this style, with her experience in swordfighting. She will cut apart enemies like they're nothing. One, two, and three slashes are enough to get an enemy down.

However, with her powers focused on Construct, her EXO's defense has gone down. Compared to Vigilante Style, she has next to no defense, so the name of the game here is fast and drastic movement, in order to avoid attacks. 

In addition to her blade, she can throw knives. These can temporarily immobilise an enemy for a good couple of seconds, allowing Cisila to get a kill in easier. Her pistol is reserved for drastic situations, and requires a lot of focus to construct. It might be used against a particularly tough foe, or to clear out a crowd. 

With this style, heads will fall.

# CISILA J. SIVETA - OLDER

## VERDICT STYLE
### Theme: Rolling Eyes Fall Down the Dragon Wall - Yakuza: Like a Dragon
###

Cisila's refined Vigilante Style, combined with elements of Meteoric Style, now used into her 40s. Now with a gracious amount of swift, Cisila delivers strikes and disarms her opponents. Just like Vigilante Style, she can use her surroundings effectively - she's just not as quick as she was before.

Her strikes hit hard, and her intense actions will break open skulls. But without her EXO at its full strength, she's forced to make use of her swiftness, similar to Meteoric style. She can also use throwing knives - but has no access to her blade or pistol. Fists are the name of the game in Chicago's current climate.

With this style, nothing will stop her. Not this last time. 

## CHAOS STYLE
### Theme: Reign - Yakuza 0
###

A style born of anger. It's used only once, when Cisila has finally had enough. The EXO is back at full strength, allowing her to use Construct to its full potential for one last time. It also brings back its defensive capabilities, but much stronger. Everything is off the table when this style reveals itself - including sparing anyone.

Using swift, combined strikes of her fists, her blades, her pistol, everything she has gained over the years - she will tear through anything that gets in her way. Damage (collateral, and to her foes) is immense, as it seems the EXO has finally gained powers unheard of due to Cisila's intense emotions in the heat of the moment. Why this hasn't happened before isn't clear, but it may be because this is the final time the EXO will have with its master. 

With this style, even on the brink of death, nothing gets in your way.


# LYLA SILVERMANN

## ASSASSIN STYLE
### Theme: Receive You the madtype - Yakuza Kiwami
### https://open.spotify.com/track/1AQiYec9NdkkXdsvtmnDU7?si=02142fdbbb91467b

Lyla's primary fighting style. She uses her assassin training to make swift and lethal attacks against enemies using a plethora of assassin tools she's gained over the years. A pair of daggers, poison darts and flashbangs. She uses these tools in a very technical manner, making sure never to get hit- seeing as she is unarmored. 

With her daggers, she can repeatedly stab enemies in critical areas without spending too much time - and with her tools she can disable her foes' ability to see, hear, or have them drop their weapon.

With this style, critical thinking is key. 

## ULTIMA STYLE

# DANI JOSERTÃ‰

## LION STYLE
### Theme: Hellish Octagon - LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name
### https://open.spotify.com/track/1fTuPDQjBMBu9aFWF0X4t0?si=c6309ca76fbc4862

Dani's signature hand-to-hand style, which was taught to them by their father. Swift punches and kicks end in a decimated enemy, and no resistance can stop The Lion. The pure *force* that Dani puts to use will end all their foes' hopes.

In intense moments, Dani might take advantage of their surroundings - similar to Cisila. With their strength, any objects not tied down to the ground can be put to use - and smashed into the faces of their foes. Even an enemy themselves may be flung right back at their allies as if they were a bowling ball.

With this style, anger is everything.
