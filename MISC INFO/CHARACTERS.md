#### 'V' - Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz - Cyberpunk 2077

Cisila Jane Siveta works to achieve something, but what that something is, she doesn't know. After losing her father, then her mother, she was left alone in her life when she turned 20.

Her father died when she was 16, during a military campaign. His body was never found- and his grave remains empty. Her mother died when was 20, killed by the pharmaceutical company PALMER-EDEN. The company she worked for. Cisila herself had been taken by PALMER-EDEN and experimented on- as part of a punishment for her mother. It didn't work- and they killed her.

PALMER-EDEN turned Cisila into an *"Ultima"*- a superhuman. An organ shoved inside her that didn't belong turned her into a person with the ability to create anything with her hands- *anything.* If she understood how it worked, how it was made, she could construct it from nothing.

The only thing she couldn't do was create an organism. Her abilities stopped at living things. Cisila left Chicago for a period of time after the experiment to take up a fire lookout position in Montana with her sister. During this time, she learned how to use her abilities. She learned that in addition to her Construct ability, a strange skeleton of metal and wires would bind itself around her almost like a protective exoskeleton. She'd call it "EXO". When she finally returned to Chicago, she used what money she had from her parents and bought herself an apartment- one she could barely fit in. She knew she couldn't keep living in her childhood home, so she took what she could from the house. 

She managed to find a job rather quickly- a large bookstore that reminded one of a library with its sheer size. She'd work there, day in, and day out. But by night, she'd put on a mask she'd constructed during her time in Montana. She'd create her own outfit so that nobody would recognize her- and leap out into the neon night city. Every night, she would gather more evidence and info on PALMER-EDEN, in an attempt to figure out how much they'd done this, *where* they were getting the Ultima organs- and most importantly, how to make them stop. She meets a strange cult-like organization that, while slightly strange, offers to help her. She meets Dani, the leader. Dani is the only person Cisila (or "V", the organization's nickname for her) trusts to help her. For months, they'd scour the underworld of the city- run into the three gangs, and dig deeper into what PALMER-EDEN's purpose really is.

And then there was Mikhail. At first, Cisila felt a connection. They decided to go out- and for the first few months, it was good. But as Cisila got more tired and tired from her lack of sleep, the two drifted apart. There was *a* connection that had happened, but Cisila didn't know what. 

She would eventually find out. And meet someone who she *really* had a connection to.

### CISILA J. SIVETA
### LIKES - DISLIKES - HOBBIES

Cisila does a lot with her free time. She, most notably, plays electric guitar. It was one of the few things she found herself really enjoying before everything went wrong- and to her, it's an anchor to the present, and what she can do.

She loves collecting trinkets. Things from her favourite movies, shows, and even games. She doesn't play video games often, though, because she never has time.

Cisila really enjoys clothing, especially footwear. She hates having to pick clothes out, however. It's difficult for her- because she likes everything in her closet and she feels as though there are too many options. Usually, she just ends up in her usual purple-grey-white pallet.

She would've been an engineer, had her life not fallen apart when it did. Using her engineer knowledge, she's able to build things using Construct. But it's not something she enjoys doing. Ever. It reminds her of what she should've been doing with her life, instead of what she *is* doing.


## LYLA SILVERMANN

#### 'A Stranger I Remain' - Free Dominguez - Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance

Lyla Silvermann is lost. She's not sure if she should be alive.

Her parents used her like a weapon. She *is* a weapon, practically. Back in Finland, she was an assassin. If you could call her one- she wasn't exactly subtle.

Ripping her victims apart like they were pieces of thin paper, she'd leave their houses covered in blood. Did she enjoy it? No. But she had to do it- lest her family kick her out and leave her with nothing.

She'd do it again, and again. And every time she would, she'd only get a cut of the money she was paid. The rest went to her family. When she was at home, she was treated like a child, even when she became a legal adult. She couldn't do much about anything- not under the piercing eyes of her family.

But suddenly, on one night when she was out for a job, it all fell apart. She was caught- somehow, some way, her family had been tricked into a setup, and she was thrown in jail. And her family didn't try to get her out. She was left there- for 3 years. Day in, day out, the prison routine degraded her mentally. Even though it was better than her family, it dragged on, and on. At least she'd had her own things in her home, but there, in a prison cell, she only had herself. And something about that scared her. Being able to think for herself with nobody telling her what to think, what to do...it *really* scared her. In the dark corners of her mind, questions popped up. Unanswerable ones. Like, "what did I do to deserve this?" and "What was wrong with mother and father?"

These questions looped around, and around in her head. Every day. For months. Until she only wanted the answers- she'd given up on waiting. Being left alone with herself made her realize that her family was horrible. If they hadn't come to get her, they must have gotten one of her siblings to do the job instead.

She was expendable. She'd thought about the one who'd set her up...who were they? Had they known what her family was?
The seemingly endless loop of prison had driven her to ask a question that confused her. A *lot.* 

Were they *trying* to save her from her family by getting her intentionally caught? She never met the clients- her father handled that. He hadn't shown any suspicious tendencies, and so she went on the job. So who was he?

That answer came sooner than she'd ever thought it would. When she was finally released- disgruntled, tired, and suspicious of everything...a man approached her. He told her he was her uncle. He explained what he'd done to her, how he knew his brother (her father) had some kind of twisted idea of family. Leading her away from the prison, and towards the unknown, Lyla felt her mind open. There was someone with answers- someone she should know. But there was something she couldn't do, her uncle told her. And that was go back to her family. She'd already figured that out- her time in prison, alone, had already answered that question.

There was only one thing her uncle could help her with, and that was start over. "But where?" She asked.

"America." He answered.

He'd managed to get them a decent ride to America on a ship. She'd wondered why, but decided not to ask. She herself distrusted planes- so maybe her uncle did aswell.

But it wasn't a normal ship- it was an icebreaker. Her uncle explained to her that in order to get out undetected, they would join an icebreaker crew. The captain, one of her uncle's best friends, took them on immediately.

And then...as they were leaving, she felt horrible. She'd thought so much about her family, and why she'd killed people...that she hadn't even given a thought to the ones she *had* killed. There wasn't anything she could do- so she pushed those thoughts away and focused on the ship. She'd learn on the journey how icebreakers operated, get to know the crew- and began to appreciate what these ships did.

But, as if she was misfortune herself, one of the crew members went for her. While she was asleep, someone had entered her cabin. She'd heard the door open and immediately sprang up. Whoever it was dropped their knife- and ran. 

She knew she wouldn't find them, so she waited until the morning- and told the captain. Someone had tried to kill her. And so, the captain interrogated every crew member. But none of them yielded. It didn't seem like any of them had done it. She investigated the entire ship herself- but she, too, couldn't find anything that incriminated any of the crew members.

When she tried to get to the captain- someone stopped her. Her *uncle* stopped her.

It was him, she realized. He'd try to kill her. Why?
"Your father didn't want you to live." He'd explained. "I wanted to do it somewhere quiet, where nobody would remember you."

And that made her *so* incredibly *angry.* She thought she'd found a way out, but instead, her escape was supposed to be her end. She was so incredibly enraged that something strange happened to her. Out of her hands, two scimitar-like blades appeared. They were made of a strange metal and wood, and she felt something also snake its way up her neck. Her hands were taken over by a strange metal apparatus that seemed to be filled with some strange, glowing green liquid. Needles like pincers could extend and retract from her fingers.

She didn't realize it, but she was an Ultima. And she used these strange powers to butcher her uncle. She'd been betrayed twice, and she didn't want to *ever* feel it again.

When she was done, her uncle's body fell over the side of the ship- and into the ice cold waters of the ocean. 

She turned away, the Ultima abilities disappearing, and felt sick.

Lyla would tell herself not to do something like that again. She finally got to America- and ran. Ending up in Chicago, she managed to build herself up into what felt like normalcy. She hadn't ever known what it was to be normal, but this must have been it.

Her thoughts of her family and her murders hung over her like a shadow. But she ignored them as much as possible. She'd found people to talk to- and began to feel the shadows back away. But whatever she was doing, it didn't feel like *her.* A part of her missed the dark nights where she drove a knife into the heart of a victim. And she couldn't get it to leave.

But every time she was this one girl she worked with, even if it was only for a few seconds, those thoughts would disappear. They'd be replaced by a feeling she couldn't describe- pure happiness.

But then someone approached, and told her if that he didn't work with her...she would be brought back to her family, and killed.

### LYLA SILVERMAN
### LIKES - DISLIKES - HOBBIES

Lyla manages herself very strictly, a symptom of life with her parents. She doesn't like or dislike anything, and the only hobby she has is reading- the only thing that gives her something to do. It's why she works at the bookstore.

## KASEY ()
### 24 (as of 2033) - Born on January 2nd, 2009
### Residence: Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A

#### 'My Own Style' - SEGA SOUND TEAM - Judgment/JUDGE EYES

A Japanese-American, Kasey came to Chicago looking for something. She met Cisila when she got a job at the Chicago Rose bookstore, and the two became fast friends. Before long, Kasey had divulged to Cisila why she'd come to the city. In Japan, she'd tried to become a detective. It hadn't gone amazingly - but she knew she'd have a chance elsewhere, even if it meant leaving her own home.

And in Chicago, she found her chance. Just like Tokyo, organized crime had made a big return. They weren't yakuza, but they knew what they were doing. Cisila had to deal with them, and when she finally told Kasey what she did, Kasey looked her straight in the eyes, and said, "How can I help?" and that was how she got her way into the underworld. There were a lot of things to see that weren't on the surface of the city- strange murders, deals, but most importantly- a giant underground meeting place for the three gangs. And Kasey understood one thing, when she saw this. Something was wrong- somehow, the gangs were just as organized as the yakuza, yet *ten times* more violent. The meeting place looked like it had been trashed time after time, likely from arguments- and fights. 

And then a man turned up dead. The Chicago Police Department chief. All signs pointed towards it being the fault of one of the gangs. And Kasey took her chance then and there. *This* is how she would prove herself. All she needed to do, was figure out which one of three gangs it was. The Cobras, the Ravens, or the elusive Dragons. Danger awaited her at every corner- evidence pointed to every gang. The cork board she used had become cluttered quickly. Pictures connecting to documents, connecting to *other* pictures, and sticky notes with questions, pointing out inconsistencies, or just plain confused notes.

And then, when she least expected it, her investigation coincided with Cisila's. Cisila had figured out that it *was* the Dragons...and it wasn't the only murder they'd committed. And what confused her even more, was that...their leader died. The leader of the Dragons had been replaced. By a man named Mikhail. Knowing Cisila, she recognized that name. She knew this was *bad,* and had far outgrown the case she'd been investigating. But that sure as hell was not going to stop her.

## ADAM "PALMER"
### Age: Uhhhh...? (as of 2033) - Was built, not born
### Residence: Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A
#### Theme: https://open.spotify.com/track/7f5Mz1wcxlhVMIHuUFoOWW?si=95ce208ef04248a5
#### Bloodstained Philosophy - SEGA SOUND TEAM - Yakuza 6: The Song of Life

Adam was a cyborg created by PALMER-EDEN for the express purpose of weeding out the remaining Ultima humans still in Chicago, primarily to kill Cisila & Lyla, due to their continued attempts to break into the PALMER-EDEN tower. He starts off polite, gets to know them, before quickly convincing them that they can get into the PALMER-EDEN tower with his help.

Obviously, this is just a ruse. The first time the three get inside, Adam turns on them- with the help of PALMER-EDEN security, and reveals his true powers. A prototype recreation of Cisila's Construct ability, though, because it's artificial, it isn't as efficient nor as useful as Cisila's. Cue first boss fight or what have you.

After this, Adam completely turns on them, having blown his cover- and begins plan B. Just hunt them down, and kill them. With total control of PALMER-EDEN's security force, he tasks them with bringing in every single Ultima-human to PALMER-EDEN, no matter what it takes. And because a lot of these people have no idea that they even *are* Ultima, things go downhill, and fast. Adam takes it upon himself to fix the issues in the city by not only attempting to cull the Ultima-humans, but anyone who tries to defend those people. Even believing PALMER-EDEN to be above the law, Adam gets permission from the CEO himself to murder any police in cold blood, should they try to stop PALMER-EDEN. In the middle of this pretty brutal culling (all things considered), Adam gets hold of Lyla, and captures her. She throws her on a train and bids her goodbye.

And you can guess how Cisila feels about this one, after her experience with Mikhail and realizing that her actions of pointlessly killing people have done far more harm than actual good. She goes after Adam. After a second encounter between the two where Cisila tries and fails to protect another Ultima-human, they fight again. Cisila suffers a pretty bad loss here, seeing as how she was one against...many, to say the least. As soon as Cisila loses, Adam takes his chance, and tells Cisila that they've "Already gotten Silvermann."

Bam. Switch flipped in Cisila's head. She escapes (much to the chagrin of Adam) and barrels her way straight to PALMER-EDEN tower. However, Lyla's not there- due to Adam locking her up in a train. However, Cisila finds out about this- be it from PALMER-EDEN's databanks, Adam himself in another encounter, or someone else who knows (perhaps the CEO). Cisila makes a beeline for the train before it leaves Chicago. Rescuing Lyla, the two resolve to stop Adam. 

Just as they do this, the city finally devolves into complete and total chaos. The two give one final chase against Adam, all the way to the tippity top of PALMER-EDEN tower, and Lyla gets held back by reinforcements that Adam sends- so Cisila is up against Adam by herself. Bam. Cue final fight music.

Cisila beats Adam to near death (Adam does the same to Cisila), but refuses to kill him. She tells him that he just has to stop, and take accountability. And that's when Adam is forced to reveal that he was never a real human- he was, in fact, a cyborg. He tears a part of his skin off of his face, revealing the complex metal mechanics hiding under his skin.
