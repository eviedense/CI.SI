Music is a super duper essential part to the feel and flow of Cisila's story.

This is a playlist that I made with every single song that fits that feel. 

And I've decided that it would be a decent idea to list out the first ~100 songs or so (the extremely relevant ones) and explain what their significance is (scene flow, vibe, setting, blah blah).

# Themes

### #1 Lost In The Rain (LOST JUDGMENT, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0VYVNTL21QUC4Hxms7wtan?si=b885ffe93cdd4573

Lost In The Rain is the title screen theme for the 2021 game Lost Judgment. The title screen features the main character leaning against a wall in an alleyway, with a cigarette in his hand. The song adds to the rainy vibes that the title screen has, and creates a calm yet downcast kind of feel.

And basically, this piece of music has the same purpose for Cisila. If she had a title screen, this would be her theme (and is also why it is the first song in the playlist). This theme is for Cisila herself

### #11 Burned Out (LIKE A DRAGON Infinite Wealth, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0DScmNNaTBTF0CPNn524H9?si=26a2db1b58ee433f

Burned Out is the title screen theme for the 2024 game LIKE A DRAGON Infinite Wealth. The title and general vibe of the theme gives off a tired feel, and is the theme for the entire group (Cisila, Lyla, Dani, Kasey, etc.).

### #12 Self Love (Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Coi Leray & Metro Boomin)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0AAMnNeIc6CdnfNU85GwCH?si=3e48ea59f6c64c47

Do I even have to explain this one?

It's this. IT'S LITERALLY THIS. IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF GWEN. I'M LOSING MY MIND

The lyrics *do* connect to how Cisila works but I don't feel like explaining that, because if you go and look at it, it should be obvious. It's also a song for when Cisila is on her daily commute (like the opening scene of ATSV)

### #13 Swing (Marvel's Spider-Man 2, EARTHGANG, Benji)

This is kind of what you expect. This song is supposed to be for the group again, but a more motivated and powerful version as opposed to Burned Out. The song (in Marvel's Spider-Man 2) is about how teamwork is essential and how working together is important blah blah. It's just that.

### #14 V (Cyberpunk 2077, Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz)
https://open.spotify.com/track/2u1FWVxAb16qbgwPgygAdj?si=1f9a7ba8a8b14332

"V" is the theme (and name) for the main character of Cyberpunk 2077, and Cisila's vigilante persona has been dubbed "V" by Dani, in accordance with their naming schemes. This theme is pure anger and fear that the V persona emanates, from the use of the metal skull mask. Imagine Batman, but if he cared less about the city. 

# Part 1


### #15 Mind As Universe (Ghostrunner 2, We Are Magonia)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0gdeQ6Qalgdzg5lniSzTG0?si=e4305da5bcc04382

The song for the very first opening scene, where Cisila executes a plan to eliminate a PALMER-EDEN higher-up to mess with the company's infrastructure. The scene takes place in the middle of a rainy night, and is our first introduction to Cisila. This theme is to set the tone and feel of Cisila's world (cyberpunk, techno-ish music, you know what I mean)

If we're talking about how the song would integrate into an actual scene, first ~20 seconds would be a slow zoom in on the city of Chicago, flying over the buildings and following the road. At about ~25 seconds, the camera comes to a halt over a certain building, as a figure (Cisila) leaps past the camera as the song properly kicks off (~30 seconds), and as Cisila leaps past, the camera whips around to follow her, as she parkours across the buildings. 

*Note: Songs 16 & 17 are just kind of there. No particular point to them, so we're skipping them.*

### #18 Day 'N' Nite (Kid Cudi) 
https://open.spotify.com/track/5wfllwdjglyQislkskYLBv?si=7f7534040c2c46e3

Similar to Self Love, Day 'N' Nite is just purely for the vibes that come from walking through a city. *Unlike* Self Love though (which is for the morning), Day 'N' Nite is for nighttime. Obviously. Come on. The song is ABOUT nights.

Here, we'll go through a couple lyrics that relate to Cisila:
*"He's all alone through the day and night, the lonely loner seems to free his mind at night"*

Right? Yeah. Cisila is really lonely all the time, having to go through a mundane routine every single day. The only time she's really got motivation to do things (as V) is at night.

And earlier in the song,
*"I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast- I think I'm first but surely finish last, last"*

This could probably illustrate what Cisila is going up against. Trying to go up against extremely organized crime (and PALMER-EDEN) which knows the city much better than her is like trying to run through a battlefield without any gear. No matter how much she thinks she may have the upper hand, something always sweeps her legs and knocks her back down to reality. 

### #19 One-Eyed Slugger (YAKUZA 0, Sega Sound Team)
