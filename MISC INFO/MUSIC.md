Music is a super duper essential part to the feel and flow of Cisila's story.

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4k0pSC7yQupDtAapqpOiPN?si=e7d49599b8fa409f

This is a playlist that I made with every single song that fits that feel. 

And I've decided that it would be a decent idea to list out the first ~100 songs or so (the extremely relevant ones) and explain what their significance is (scene flow, vibe, setting, blah blah).


# Themes



### #1 Lost In The Rain (LOST JUDGMENT, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0VYVNTL21QUC4Hxms7wtan?si=b885ffe93cdd4573

Lost In The Rain is the title screen theme for the 2021 game Lost Judgment. The title screen features the main character leaning against a wall in an alleyway, with a cigarette in his hand. The song adds to the rainy vibes that the title screen has, and creates a calm yet downcast kind of feel.

And basically, this piece of music has the same purpose for Cisila. If she had a title screen, this would be her theme (and is also why it is the first song in the playlist). This theme is for Cisila herself


## Refer to FIGHTING STYLES for songs #2-8

### #11 Burned Out (LIKE A DRAGON Infinite Wealth, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0DScmNNaTBTF0CPNn524H9?si=26a2db1b58ee433f

Burned Out is the title screen theme for the 2024 game LIKE A DRAGON Infinite Wealth. The title and general vibe of the theme gives off a tired feel, and is the theme for the entire group (Cisila, Lyla, Dani, Kasey, etc.).

### #12 Self Love (Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Coi Leray & Metro Boomin)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0AAMnNeIc6CdnfNU85GwCH?si=3e48ea59f6c64c47

Do I even have to explain this one?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek40XtVsO7g&t

It's this. IT'S LITERALLY THIS. IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF GWEN. I'M LOSING MY MIND

The lyrics *do* connect to how Cisila works but I don't feel like explaining that, because if you go and look at it, it should be obvious. It's also a song for when Cisila is on her daily commute (like the opening scene of ATSV)


### #13 I'm Ready (Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales, Jaden)
https://open.spotify.com/track/4kTliHBy7w2SOMtm8qMmOW?si=b15f7cfa36274a5a

### #14 Swing (Marvel's Spider-Man 2, EARTHGANG, Benji)

This is kind of what you expect. This song is supposed to be for the group again, but a more motivated and powerful version as opposed to Burned Out. The song (in Marvel's Spider-Man 2) is about how teamwork is essential and how working together is important blah blah. It's just that.

### #15 V (Cyberpunk 2077, Marcin Przybyłowicz)
https://open.spotify.com/track/2u1FWVxAb16qbgwPgygAdj?si=1f9a7ba8a8b14332

"V" is the theme (and name) for the main character of Cyberpunk 2077, and Cisila's vigilante persona has been dubbed "V" by Dani, in accordance with their naming schemes. This theme is pure anger and fear that the V persona emanates, from the use of the metal skull mask. Imagine Batman, but if he cared less about the city. 


# Part 1


### #16 Mind As Universe (Ghostrunner 2, We Are Magonia)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0gdeQ6Qalgdzg5lniSzTG0?si=e4305da5bcc04382

The song for the very first opening scene, where Cisila executes a plan to eliminate a PALMER-EDEN higher-up to mess with the company's infrastructure. The scene takes place in the middle of a rainy night, and is our first introduction to Cisila. This theme is to set the tone and feel of Cisila's world (cyberpunk, techno-ish music, you know what I mean)

If we're talking about how the song would integrate into an actual scene, first ~20 seconds would be a slow zoom in on the city of Chicago, flying over the buildings and following the road. At about ~25 seconds, the camera comes to a halt over a certain building, as a figure (Cisila) leaps past the camera as the song properly kicks off (~30 seconds), and as Cisila leaps past, the camera whips around to follow her, as she parkours across the buildings. 

*Note: Songs 17 & 18 are just kind of there. No particular point to them, so we're skipping them.*

### #19 Day 'N' Nite (Kid Cudi) 
https://open.spotify.com/track/5wfllwdjglyQislkskYLBv?si=7f7534040c2c46e3

Similar to Self Love, Day 'N' Nite is just purely for the vibes that come from walking through a city. *Unlike* Self Love though (which is for the morning), Day 'N' Nite is for nighttime. Obviously. Come on. The song is ABOUT nights.

Here, we'll go through a couple lyrics that relate to Cisila:
*"He's all alone through the day and night, the lonely loner seems to free his mind at night"*

Right? Yeah. Cisila is really lonely all the time, having to go through a mundane routine every single day. The only time she's really got motivation to do things (as V) is at night.

And earlier in the song,
*"I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast- I think I'm first but surely finish last, last"*

This could probably illustrate what Cisila is going up against. Trying to go up against extremely organized crime (and PALMER-EDEN) which knows the city much better than her is like trying to run through a battlefield without any gear. No matter how much she thinks she may have the upper hand, something always sweeps her legs and knocks her back down to reality. 

### #19 One-Eyed Slugger (YAKUZA 0, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/2cKRAl7WLjOFAXPyNo6q53?si=f47f9c79760d4ac7

This theme from YAKUZA 0 is for one of Goro Majima's fighting styles, Slugger. But in the context of Cisila's world, this is probably a song for fights that she has to endure without the use of her powers (e.g. a fight that happens in broad daylight).


### #21 Assault (LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/2PGEkK4ddU826RLmRTak71?si=09737df69f0149d0

This song is for the section of part 1 where Cisila has to make her way through a construction site, fighting through the Dragons' forces to save Lyla (or at least, she believes she's doing that).

Pretty self explanatory. The song itself in LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN is for gameplay sections where you're constantly fighting to get somewhere, e.g. escape a monastery or rescue your handler.


### #22 怨魔の契り (Pledge of Demon) (YAKUZA 0, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/131LgkYxiituZMmrAaSk9Y?si=063959e93e7b43dc

This song is for the second Daisaku Kuze fight in YAKUZA 0, with a strong percussion focus at the start, with a good buildup.

But as a song for Cisila's story, this is for the first fight between Cisila and Mikhail, once Cisila figures out that he is the murderer behind the strange and gorey murders happening in Chicago. She's basically forced to engage Mikhail, letting Lyla escape in the process. This fight happens in the middle of an abandoned school (where Mikhail basically kidnapped Cisila, and Lyla freed her, defying Mikhail) and is the first time that Cisila feels like she has control over a situation, seeing as how she notices that Mikhail is actually a rather inexperienced fighter (but this does NOT mean he isn't brutal).

### Songs #23-26 (Subterranean Castle, Triplet After Triplet, Pellagra, & SEIRYU NO RAN) - (All from YAKUZA: LIKE A DRAGON, Sega Sound Team)

Subterranean Castle is infiltration music. Simple.

Triplet After Triplet is Mikhail's theme, when Cisila finally realizes what he is.

Pellagra & SEIRYU NO RAN are for when Cisila & Lyla finally team up with Dan to find Mikhail and prove he did it (Pellagra for fights, & SEIRYU NO RAN for panic mode music for when the police catch onto what they're doing, and try to stop them- because it's actually beneficial for them to have a working relationship with Mikhail)

### #27 Stigma (LIKE A DRAGON Infinite Wealth, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/4On1R4NlSavi3Tvt6w1dqm?si=53a90927f52e4f41

Final push to find Mikhail, where Dani finally joins them. Cisila, Dani, Lyla & Dan up against the gang of the Dragons (the one Mikhail became leader of), in a construction site for the second tallest building in the city.

### #28 Destination (JUDGE EYES/JUDGMENT, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/3FNO67SjWfXSDqpvQp1gwo?si=02309ff2cf25465a

After an incredibly difficult and long fight up towards the top of the construction site (where Dani knows that Mikhail is hiding) Cisila makes her way up, alone. The other three stay back to fight off any reinforcements (under Cisila's encouragement- they obviously wanted to go with her). When Cisila confronts Mikhail, the two recount their relationship, and the two figure out why they even found each other in the first place- their Ultima abilities (Cisila's EXO & Construct) are two halves of the same thing. Mikhail's is focused on flesh, muscle and bone- anything alive, and Cisila's is everything without life.

And when Mikhail does the funny cliche "we can work together", Cisila turns him down and says that he's basically the worst human being in the city. So Mikhail replies with a simple, "kill me, then" or something along those lines, and Cisila shakes her head. Bam. Mikhail lunges at her and engages in a fight, ripping a metal pipe off of the half-finished walls and trying to bash her head in with it to get her to kill him. But even if Cisila almost always killed, a flip has switched at this point. For a split second, her first reaction is to whip out her blade, but after a couple seconds of defense, it disappears and she raises her fists. Cue music. Yeah.


# Part 2


### #29 Two-Faced Castle (LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/6GHmxVpI3yHDyuFqHc01NB?si=237f2f16c34f485a

The first true musical cue of Part 2, Two-Faced Castle. In LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN, this plays when Kazuma Kiryu is forced to flee the floating Castle, as he's being attacked.

For Cisila, this plays when herself and Dan are forced to escape the Dragons' compound after a meeting turns sour. This sequence is based off of, like, every Yakuza/Like a Dragon escape section, so it makes sense to use a song from one of those sequences.

### #30 Psycho's Anthem (LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/0nxspn27RUWk57Hbzsn08c?si=a7294a4d85ec4fa0

This one's a fun one. This is the first true "boss" fight based completely off of a Yakuza boss fight sequence. The fight is not only the first fight in the Part, but also the first one directly related to the infrastructure of the three gangs. Cisila and Dan get out of the compound and halfway across the entrance courtyard, when the leader of the Ravens, "The Eagle", finally catches up to them. Lyla appears and helps Dan escape, while Cisila takes on The Eagle. 

Cinematically speaking, the "intro cutscene" for this would play out like a Yakuza boss fight transition. In the writing, The Eagle wields his knife and brings it down on Cisila- who dodges around it. Then, a few swift strikes between the two occur as our theoretical camera follows them, flying around them while getting a good angle, and then on the final hit- the one that brings them the closest together, everything slows down as the song starts, and your traditional Yakuza boss fight titles appear. You know the deal, something like:

### **PATRIARCH OF THE RAVENS**
#### |**"THE EAGLE"**|

Like that. Kinda. I dunno.

### #31 & 32 In Full Blast & Bring It On (LIKE A DRAGON GAIDEN The Man Who Erased His Name, Sega Sound Team)

These two are for different kinds of fights (think team-ups) specifically with Dan & Lyla involved, during the part of the story where the gangs go into full-on war and it's causing *such* a big problem that fights are constantly breaking out in the streets.

### #33 Irritation (LIKE A DRAGON Infinite Wealth, Sega Sound Team, 83key)
https://open.spotify.com/track/4ZBr80A44P1qqp6O6rQe6m?si=529c194b7a7c4285

### #34 Get Over It (YAKUZA Kiwami, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/3MVkgrItUEbsS3Cc1oBLkL?si=26f1a9ebe45f4948

### #35 Scarlet Scar by Fierce Tiger (YAKUZA Kiwami, Sega Sound Team)
https://open.spotify.com/track/3AP9s2kKTFFthaww28OkGH?si=30ac6cadf24c4a16
