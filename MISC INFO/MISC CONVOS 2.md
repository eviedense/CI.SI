### - On Cisila's Family

*Lyla was looking through Cisila's apartment. There were a lot of strange things one doesn't usually need. Especially, Lyla noticed, this strangely out of place chair that didn't match the rest of the decor. It was like a black sheep, decor from decades past. But it wasn't the only one.*

*She noticed a couple of old lamps sitting next to a window, dormant. They weren't plugged in, so why were they here?*

Lyla - *She reaches out, and carefully pulls on the lamp's string to turn it on. It clicks as she tugs, but no light comes on. She leansover the table that the lamp's sitting on, and notices that the cord isn't even there. It had been cut off.*

Cisila - *She's sitting on the couch, giving Lyla a confused, and slightly suspicious look as her back is turned.*

Cisila - *She struggles to speak for a moment, but she speaks after a few seconds of thinking.*  What- What are you doing? *She stumbles over her words slightly, as she usually does. She brushes the thick waft of hair covering the right side of her face away for a second, revealing her other eye for a brief moment. Lyla doesn't see this.*

Lyla - Huh? *She looks back.*  I was just confused, these- *She indicates the lamps sitting on the table by nodding at them.*  - why are these here? They don't work. *It sounds as though she's slightly judgmental, having had to sell anything she could get her hands on. Why would Cisila just leave useless things sitting around, instead of selling them? Money was important.*

Cisila - *She gets up, rolling her wrists. They hurt.*  I stole them from my old house. *Cisila sounds firm.*  I don't care if they don't work, they used to be my parents' stuff. 

Lyla - *Lyla looks taken aback, slightly. She didn't realize they were her parents'.*  Shit- sorry. I didn't realize...but- lamps? *She makes a face.*  Out of everything you could have taken?

*Cisila walks up to the table and leans on it. Closer, Lyla can see how tired Cisila looks. Eyebags under her eyes were normal, but they were darker than usual.*

Cisila - *She fidgets with one of the lamps' strings, tugging on it. It clicks on and off repeatedly.*  My dad would use them to calm me down. It- it sounds weird, right?

Lyla - *She shakes her head, but doesn't say anything.*

Cisila - On a stormy night or... *She struggles a bit.* ...or when the power went out, he'd hook these up in my room. I used to be terrified of thunderstorms, and the dark...

*There's a short pause.*

Cisila - He, uh...he... *She twirls the string around her finger.*  He'd call them knights. My defense against the...y'know, the dark.

Lyla - *She giggles a bit.*  Isn't that cute...

Cisila - *She shakes her head and smiles.*  There's also that chair over there. *She tugs her finger out of the string and points at the far side of the room behind her, where the chair is sitting.* It used to sit in my dad's office.

Lyla - Did you take anything else?

Cisila - *She scoffs.*  Dani wouldn't help me with any more. I think someone also noticed me breaking in, so, uh...

Lyla - Your own house. Someone noticed you breaking into your house. That doesn't sound like a crime, ya know... *She cocks her head to the side.*

Cisila - ...Nobody was gonna recognize me anyways. I didn't have any spare keys- nothing. Mom must've had the keys when... *She sighs.*  Yeah.

Lyla - Oh. *She doesn't look like she meant to bring the topic there. She turns away and makes her way back to the couch.*

Cisila - Hang on, actually. *She raises a hand towards Lyla to make her stop.*  I got a couple pictures.

Lyla - Huh? Really?

Cisila - *She nods.* Not really that hard to get them, though. *She makes her way over to the small kitchen inset and opens one of the cabinets. She pulls out two small framed photos out of the cabinet, gingerly placing them on the granite countertop.*

Lyla - *Lyla too gets over to the kitchen inset and leans over Cisila's shoulder to take a look.*  ...Is that you? *She reaches over Cisila's arm and points at one of the two pictures.*

*The framed photo is a family photo. The frame is weathered, but the picture inside it is still pristine. A smaller Cisila, her father, her mother, and her sister are all grouped outside their home.*

Lyla - That...doesn't look like Chicago. *She sets her chin on Cisila's shoulder. She might be taller than Cisila, but it's still comfortable.*

Cisila - *She picks up the photo.*  It's not. I had to convince Dani to get me all the way to Montana. They, uh...they weren't happy about it.

Lyla - ... *She shrugs.*  It's a long way, isn't it? I'd understand.

Cisila - I mean, yeah, but... *She turns the photo over to look at the frame.*  They could've at least let me take more stuff. They brought a damn van.

Lyla - What's that other one?

Cisila - *She puts down the family photo and lifts up the other one. She feels her lip twitch as she looks at it.*

*An equally pristine photo of her father in his military gear, with his squadmates. They look happy.*

Cisila - I needed something to remind me what Dad looked like. He'd always disappear for weeks, or months...and show up back home, tired. *She turns the frame over, and points at a scribble on the back.*  Look.

*The writing is in some kind of permanent marker, and says "In case you ever forget what Dad looks like."*

Cisila - My mom took that picture, and gave it to me. She had a lot of time before, y'know...

Lyla - Before Palmer showed up, yeah. Fuck... *She backs away from Cisila and stretches*  What did your mom even do?

Cisila - *She shrugs dismissively. She feels herself getting annoyed.* I don't know... *She sputters sarcastically.* ...why do you think I'm here? *She sets the frame down and strides back towards the window. Turning her head to look at Lyla, she points out the window.*

*The giant, sleek tower of PALMER-EDEN Pharmaceutical leers over the horizon. It's the biggest tower in the city.*

Cisila - That. That place. *She grinds her teeth.*

Lyla - *Lyla stares at her, concerned.*  I didn't mean to-

Cisila - *She shakes her head.*  No. I get it. I just... *Her pointing gesture clenches into a fist and she drops her arm back to her side.*  They did it on purpose. She didn't just *die.* She was murdered. And I'll *prove* it. *There's a gleam in her eye. She's determined.*

Lyla - *She timidly makes her way up to Cisila and grabs hold of her hands quietly.*  You don't...need to get so mad. I know.

Cisila - *Her eyes flick to the side, and she tries to avoid eye contact.*  I want to get back at them.

Lyla - And you're working on that. You already have it covered. *She lets go of Cisila's hands and cups them around her cheeks instead.*  Okay? You've got to focus. Getting mad...it...doesn't help.

*Cisila's lip twitches again. She looks a little annoyed, again. However, she doesn't move.*

Lyla - *She lets go of Cisila's face and rests her hands on Cisila's shoulders.* You should sit down.

Cisila - *She slides away from Lyla slowly and sits back down on the couch, quietly fidgeting with her fingers.*  Sorry. *She mumbles. She doesn't feel speaking.*

Lyla - *She sits next to Cisila, crossing her legs.*  What was your family like?

Cisila - *She doesn't respond for several seconds. Pieces are clicking together in her head.*  I- well... *She tilts her head, thinking.*  If they weren't good, I...I wouldn't be sad about it, would I?

Lyla - *She nods.*  Yeah, I guess...I guess you're right. *She thinks of her own family. If they died, she wouldn't feel a thing.*

Cisila - Especially my dad. When he was actually home, he'd...he'd try to make it up. Every time. *She remembers all the small gifts, the trips, and the games.*

*There's a small pause. Both of them are thinking.*

Cisila - My mom was always tired. I was- I was too much for her. *She giggles quietly.* Not only was she important to Palmer, she had to take care of a rowdy child and her sister. *She remembers her sister. Her face falls a bit.* My sister- she...was strange. She inspired me to be an engineer, though. I went to her when my parents died, but then she-

Lyla - *She quietly puts her hand on Cisila's shoulder.*  I know. *She sounds solemn.* You've said it already, you don't have to tell me again.

Cisila - *She swallows whatever words she was about to say, and looks down. She sighs.* Mhm. *Cisila sounds resigned.*

Lyla - Anybody else in your family? *She leans back into the couch, getting comfortable.*

Cisila - *Looks up at Lyla, and shakes her head.*  No. Well- yeah. *She's accidentally jumbling her words again. She shakes her head.* There's family, but they're just...way down south, and- I despised them, every time I saw them. They were... *She gestures with her hands while trying to figure out what word to say*  ...horrible, I guess. 'Specially my grandparents. Dad's side. 

Lyla - *She raises an eyebrow.*  Why them?

Cisila - ...Cooed over me like I was this- *she snaps her fingers for a few seconds, trying to continue.*  this little princess. *What goes through her mind is memories of every time she had to stay with her grandparents. They aren't pleasant.*  My sister didn't like it. Neither did I. They creeped us out.

Lyla - Urgh... *She makes a face. In her head, images flash through. Given the chance, she'd rip their heads off. Then her mind shuts that down. That's not what normal people do. But she can't stop the images.*

Cisila - My parents knew it aswell. They kept us away from them whenever they got the chance. But my dad folded to them a couple times out of guilty...he could be- kinda soft, sometimes. *She remembers the one time her grandparents visited. Her dad finally relented, and let Cisila and her sister stay with their grandparents for a couple of days. The look of horror on her sister's face still stands out in her mind.*

Lyla - *Lyla spots the change in Cisila's expression. Annoyance? A slight twinge of fear?*  You okay? I didn't think...it'd...

Cisila - *She shakes her head, breaking out of the memory.*  No, it's fine. My sister was...relentless in making sure my grandparents didn't get near me. Thank God, because if anyone let them teach me- I wouldn't be like this.

Lyla - Really? They're *that* kind of bad?

Cisila - No no, no... *She shakes her head again, and smiles.*  They just wanted me to be a certain way. Kinda like they wanted to fix their mistake with Dad. He wasn't happy about that. 

Lyla - Pssht, *She cocks her head,*  bet not. I wouldn't be happy either. That's just admitting your kid's a mistake, isn't it?

Cisila - Yeah. That's when he stopped talking to them. Wouldn't budge from his stance, either, for once...

Lyla - Jeez... *She pulls out her phone and checks it.*  Ah, *paska*, I need to go. *She splutters, as she hurriedly gets up and puts her phone away, walking to the door. She scoops her coat off of the coat hanger and pulls it on.*

Cisila - *She gets up,*  Really? 

Lyla - *She buttons the coat up and flaps up the collar to make sure it looks right. She can't look bad.*  Yeah. Not a big deal. 

Cisila - Someone having problems?

Lyla - Yeah. Dan. He's being overwhelmed by being a... *She re-checks her phone.*  a cashier. I don't get that guy.

Cisila - I'll come with. No reason for me to stay. *She yanks her jacket off of the hanger, and pulls it on. She scoops her satchel off the hanger aswell, and puts it on.*

*The two leave, and the apartment door's lock clicks as Cisila locks it behind her. The apartment is left empty, the remaining daylight shining down through the solitary window onto the small table with the old lamps.*
