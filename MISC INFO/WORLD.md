## PALMER-EDEN
PALMER-EDEN is/was a pharmaceutical company focused on the benefit and improvement of human life. Their scientists work day and night to develop cures and medicine, and their advertisements make it seem as though they are the premier company to go to for medicine. However, under the surface

## HAMMERHEAD LTD.
A jack-of-all-trades hardware company. They produce top of the line military gear, such as night vision goggles, bulletproof vests, and holsters. Additionally, they design, construct and sell their own line of firearms for civilian and military use. They have taken over as the U.S Army's top firearm producer, and most gear available to U.S marines is straight from Hammerhead.

They also have a second division dedicated to transportation: From primitive space technology to on the ground offroad vehicles, they have the market cornered. In 2078, they will be one of few companies still operating in the remains of the U.S, as PALMER-EDEN's direct competitor.
