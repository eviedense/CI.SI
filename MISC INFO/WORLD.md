## PALMER-EDEN
PALMER-EDEN is/was a pharmaceutical company focused on the benefit and improvement of human life. Their scientists work day and night to develop cures and medicine, and their advertisements make it seem as though they are the premier company to go to for medicine. However, under the surface, the CEO of the company Martin Palmer has developed a morbid fascination with an unknown occurrence in human beings: Something he has called "Ultima". An organ in one's body that gives them superpowers. Palmer has developed a surgery that rips out the organ from one person, and gives it to another - a notoriously difficult procedure to those who know Ultima exist. The cost is immense: The donor dies. The one who receives it either is kicked out, or kept at PALMER-EDEN, never to be seen again. Nothing the patient can do will stop PALMER-EDEN's work.

In 2078, PALMER-EDEN will have grown to become one of the largest countries in the nation - capable of building a city. It is the only thing keeping the remains of the U.S together, with its military might - but they've discovered something underneath the sacred grounds of America, something that changes everything.

## HAMMERHEAD LTD.
A jack-of-all-trades hardware company. They produce top of the line military gear, such as night vision goggles, bulletproof vests, and holsters. Additionally, they design, construct and sell their own line of firearms for civilian and military use. They have taken over as the U.S Army's top firearm producer, and most gear available to U.S marines is straight from Hammerhead.

They also have a second division dedicated to transportation: From primitive space technology to on the ground offroad vehicles, they have the market cornered. In 2078, they will be one of few companies still operating in the remains of the U.S, as PALMER-EDEN's direct competitor.
