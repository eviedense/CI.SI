Okay, I'm trying to think of some ideas for the new and improved *DESOLATION*, set just a year before Cisila's mother dies.

### I've got a core friend group of highschool friends: 
Cisila, obviously. \
Amelia, the main Cisila version of Am√© from ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. \
Derrick, same deal as Amelia. \
Kaitlyn, newcomer. Likely the love interest as Cisila learns she's a lesbian. \
Dakota, also newcomer. The one who spurs the story on by disappearing after a party.

### I've got a vague idea of a plot:
The whole story is centered around the group of friends, fresh out of highschool. Their idea of a summer, free from high school after years? A bucket list. Do everything they can before entering adulthood proper and going their separate ways. Drink. Party. But the big one: Make a map of the entire town on their own. Figure out what all the old, abandoned buildings are for. They'll add notes of particularly interesting hangout areas, places not to go, shops to avoid...just so that, were they ever to return after leaving the town (as all of them are planning to do), they won't forget anything.

But while the group explores the city as a group, Dakota goes missing. A gang rolls into town, and from the shadows, takes it over. Cisila believes the gang has something to do with Dakota's disappearance, but her friends urge her to stay away. Yet Dakota was one of Cisila's oldest friends, and she can't just let Dakota disappear...or, for that matter, die. There's only one way to figure out where Dakota's gone: play detective. 

But since this isn't the normal superpowered Ultima Cisila with her combat training from Dani and detective insights from Kasey, she struggles. Her father did teach her how to fight, but she's never had to do it against people like this strange gang. She's never had experiences with investigations, and she makes the wrong connections a lot of the time. This isn't supposed to be a magical "she's perfect" story to show why she's much better in the main story, rather to show what would've happened had she not found Dani and Kasey. Fortunately for her, Dani will show up here- the first time they meet. It's also the first time Cisila kills. It's supposed to basically be her first for everything, before her life goes off the deep end when her mother dies (I want to have that happen in an epilogue).
